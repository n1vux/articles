Misc articles in lieu of blogging

This Repository drives
a [github.io](https://n1vux.github.io/articles/index.html)
website. Anything i want to publish goes here.

The largest section is devoted to the Literary Estate of M A Padlipsky.

Other things will appear as whimsy strikes. 

I am using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) and [aspell](http://aspell.net)
to render MarkDown to HTML for this.
I use a mix of ReText, gedit, and gvim for editing MD; i like the live
preview mode in ReText, but the different syntax highlighting in different
editors is helpful to understand the ambiguities of MD.

You can provide feedback by using the **new issue** button on the **Issues** tab.
