<p>The final attack on 11-11 morning is generally considered to be even more pointless, gratuitous slaughter than the previous 4 years were. The offered terms specified an Armistice time of 11AM on 11-11, as a deadline for negotiations, so the time of possible cessation was known in advance. The Armistice was signed at 5:10 AM, and announced on Eiffel Tower radio shortly thereafter in French (dated 05 hr 00), and in English at 6:14. (This was sent in plain language, not code; authentication was implicit - Eiffel radio was the biggest station in the region, impossible to jam; all the radiomen would have known its sound.)</p>
<p>On some sectors, the day's advance was canceled, and then un-canceled: it was important that the Germans went home knowing they were beat in the field, not just in negotiations, to liberate a few cities if possible. Artillery accelerated their firing towards the cease-fire time, as fired ammunition would be much lighter to load up than unfired. (Some supposedly shifted there aim humanely to where they thought no one was to limit the harm.)</p>
<p>For #WW100 Armistice Day, let´s remember those cut down that day in particular. Since I'm sitting in Boston, I'll focus on Massachusians, where they fell that day, and what their units were doing.</p>

<p>After the success of the Sept-October Meuse-Argonne offensive, which reversed Germany's gains in their spring last-chance offensive, the allies were reorganizing, and preparing for a final push to Metz (and perhaps the Rhine?). It was scheduled for mid November -- Nov 14th in the center, Nov 11th on the right, with harassing raids in the meantime to stay in contact. But as Armistice talks picked up - after Austria made separate peace - they noticed the Germans were retiring to new positions with slightest provocation, sometimes with none.</p>

<p>Our first entry is a bit of a mystery.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>MacAlpine, Harry Douglas, Sapper,</strong> C. E. F.: killed in action 11 Nov., 1918.<br />
Enl. 25 Feb., 1917, 1st W. S. Royal Engrs., Canadian Army.<br />
Born 2 March, 1887, at Bear River, N. S., son of Henry Judson and Luvenia (Hill) MacAlpine; brother of William Edward and Alfred Freeman (1st Lieut., M. C). Married Josephine Sinnott (deceased). Child: Walter Francis. Cousin of Edward E. Nickles, page 352.<br />
(Mass.Comm.Gold-Star narrative <a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A Greater Bostonian (apparently of Somerville, listed under Middelsex County), possibly with a Nova Scotian wife and other Nova Scotian connections, enlists in <strong>Canadian Royal Engineers</strong>. I haven't decoded ´1st W.S.' but Canadian memorial records assign Sapper H.D.MacAlpine to <strong>&quot;Inland Water Transport&quot; (IWT)</strong> which is under/grouped as &quot;Inland Waterway and Docks&quot; (IW&amp;D, sometimes IWTD), which includes narrow-gauge RR and canal-barge ambulances &amp; hospital ships, as well as cargo barging for RE. Classed as &quot;Imperial service outside CEF&quot; in some Canadian statistics, so apparently CRE outside of Division combat engineer Co's seems to be drafted into BEF RE? IWT/IW&amp;D would be Horizontal Engineering or Service of Supply in our nomenclature?</p>
<p>He is sometimes indexed as McAlpine. Only the Mass.Commission<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> source says KIA, others say Unknown or died of war only, very unclear.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Buried: Longuenesse (St Omer) Souvenir Cemetery, Pas de Calais, France, V. E. 52. (multiple sources)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it is unknown where he died on 11-11, and what unit he was with; quite logically it would be Canadian Corps in BEF taking Mons on 11-11, but he could have been with CEF in Siberia, or he could have been elsewhere with Royal Engineers, or with other BEF troops. (RE IWT was very active in Mesopotamia and Italy.)</p>
<p>If he fell at Mons, as is somewhat likely for a Canadian KIA on 11-11, being with Canadian 2nd Div or 3rd Div would be most plausible. Troops actually in Mons were 7th Canadian Infantry Brigade (CIB; the RCR, PPCLI, 42d Montréal Bn, and 49th Bn). There was only 1 Canadian KIA in the city on 11-11, but was not our Bostonian-Canadian MacAlpine He could have fallen on the approach, or elsewhere in vicinity with 2nd &amp; 3rd Can Divs?</p>
<p>His (C)RE specialty IWT was supposedly (partially wholly) drafted into Durham Light Infantry (DLI), who were also near Mons, but were rotated out prior to Armistice.</p>

<p>which is confirmed by <a href="https://archive.org/stream/6thbattaliondur00ainuoft/6thbattaliondur00ainuoft_djvu.txt">6th Bn Durham Light Inf. History</a> that they received a draft of men from Royal Engineers IWT&amp;D, but that battalion was later reduced in combat to cadre for new troops, and they were distributed to other battalions by 6 Nov, so were nowhere in particular on 11-11.</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/cihm_991347/page/n407">Durhams History</a> says the Durhams were in reserve from 8 Nov, so not at Mons; any 11-11 battle dead in Durhams would be died of earlier wounds (or detached to a unit in-line, or hit by deep-zone harassment).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By the evening of the 4th, our troops had reached Laneuville, opposite Stenay, and had swept through the great Foret de Dienlet, reaching the outskirts of Beaumont. . . .<br />
On the night of the lOth-11th and the morning of the 11th, the Fifth Corps, in the First Army, forced a crossing of the Meuse east of Beaumont and gained the commanding heights within the reëntrant of the river, thus completing our control of the Mense River line. At 6 A. M. on the 11th, notification was received from Marshal Foch's headquarters that the armistice had been signed and that hostilities would cease at 11 A.M.<br />
Preparatory measures had already been taken to insure the prompt transmission to the troops of the announcement of an armistice. However, the advance east of Beaumont on the morning of the 11th had been so rapid and communication across the river was so difficult that there was some fighting in isolated portions of that front after 11 A.M.&quot;</p>

<p>1LT Wilson is noted in <a href="https://archive.org/details/historyof89thdiv00engl/page/398">89th Division history</a> Honor Roll as <strong>Co G, 356th Inf</strong>, which in WW1 division would put him in <strong>2d Bn,</strong> 356th.</p>
<p><em>Beaumont-en-Argonne</em> is shown on ABMC map of 2nd and 89th's Meuse crossings, west of Létanne and Pouill-sur-Meuse. (Note, this one map is rotated so North is down and East is left!) Beaumont would have been a Rear Area on 11-11 -- on the 2nd Div side of the line, barely -- but the crossing is considered to have spring <em>from</em> Beaumont, so we may presume 1LT Wilson fell at the front, on the crossings.

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Davitt, William F., First Lieutenant, Chaplain:</strong> killed in action 11 Nov., 1918, near Ecurey, 75 minutes before the armistice.<br />
Commissioned 1st Lieut., Chaplain, 6 Jan., 1918, and assigned to 120th M.G. Bn., 32d Div.; trans, to 125th Inf., 32d Div. He had volunteered as Chaplain, K. of C, at outbreak of war, and was assigned Oct., 1917, to Camp McArthur, Tex. Overseas 10 Feb., 1918.<br />
Born 8 Dec, 1886, at Holyoke, son of Lawrence (born in Canada) and Mary (Kane, born in Ireland, died 1920) Davitt; brother of James L. (1st Lieut., 94th Aero Sq., A. E. F.) of Willimansett. Holy Cross College, 1907; Grand Seminary, Montreal, Can. Priest, St. Anne's Parish, Lenox. One of the last American officers killed in the World War. Post 625, V. F. W., Chicopee, named in his honor, also Fr. Davitt Council, K. of C, Lenox, and a square in Worcester.<br />
<strong>Silver Star</strong> Citation 3 June, 1919: &quot;For gallantry in action near Courmont, France, 4 Oct., 1918, in burying the dead under heavy shell fire.&quot;<br />
<strong>Cited in G. O. No. 26,</strong> 20 Nov., 1918: &quot;For faithful and conscientious performance of duty and for extreme coolness under shell fire in the performance of his duty as <strong>Chief Burial Officer, 5th Corps,</strong> during the Meuse-Argonne operations.<br />
<strong>Croix de Guerre with palm:</strong> &quot;During the advance from the Ourcq to the Vesle from July 31 to Aug. 6, 1918, he carried out his duties heedless of danger and without interruption under a violent fire. By his comforting words and his fine example of abnegation and bravery he encouraged the men of his regiment who were advancing to the assault.&quot;<br />
Recommended for D. S. C: &quot;During the advance from Courmont to Mount St. Martin, Chaplain Davitt worked single-handed without ceasing for anything, collecting the dead of his Division (32d) and looking after the burial. He did this under violent fire, to which he apparently paid no attention. While doing this work he stopped to encourage with cheerful words and advice the enlisted men along the line who also were under fire. The results of his work were 125 American soldiers buried, many wounded cared for, and soldiers in the line encouraged.&quot;<br />
Cited for bravery August 6, 1918, during operations along the Vesle River: &quot;To rescue 40 wounded soldiers who were temporarily isolated from their command, he led a party of volunteers through a hail of machine gun bullets. All were rescued and returned to their command without the loss of a single man.&quot;<br />
Cited for bravery Oct. 20, 1918, during the Argonne offensive: &quot;To rescue three wounded soldiers, he leaped over the top of the trench, and, under enemy machine-gun fire, dragged them to safety one by one.&quot;<br />

Located about 600 yards in front of the American lines after the St. Mihiel operation, this little wood was the scene of many small but bitter fights in which at different times the 89th, 37th and 28th Divisions, in that order, participated. It was occupied by the 28th Division on November 10 and held until after the Armistice.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Dommartin-la-Chaussée. Site of a large German supply depot. The town was in the main line of resistance of the Hindenburg Line. Attempts of the 28th Division to capture it on November 10 were defeated with considerable losses.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<strong>Mon Plaisir Farm.</strong> A strongly organized place in the Hindenburg Line which was attacked at different times after the St. Mihiel offensive by the 78th and 7th Divisions. The 28th and 89th Divisions sent patrols to it. The farm was still in the hands of the Germans when the Armistice became effective.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Marimbois Farm. This farm was in German hands at the close of the St. Mihiel offensive. From September 16 on patrols of the 42d and, later, of the 89th and 28th Divisions frequently clashed with the enemy there. It was occupied by the 28th Division on November 9 and held until the Armistice.&quot;</p>

<p>African-American Massachusetts National Guard members served overseas with US 372nd Infantry, nominally of 93d Div (&quot;Provisional&quot;, &quot;Colored&quot;), but both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/371st_Infantry_Regiment_(United_States)">371st Inf</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/372nd_Infantry_Regiment_(United_States)">372d Inf</a> fought with the French, during this Operation, in the Fr.157 Div; and their sibling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/369th_Infantry_Regiment_(United_States)">369th Inf</a> - the famous &quot;Harlem Hell Fighters,&quot; 15th NYNG - in the Fr.161st Div. This places them at the right end of the line, in Alsace near Switzerland. They were rotated out of line weeks before armistice, so no 11-11 KIA; but a half dozen Massachusians and many more from elsewhere in 371st &amp; 372d fell at Bussey Farm in September, and 372d's <a href="http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/fstowers.htm">Corporal Freddie Stowers's Medal of Honor</a> for actions at Hill 188 in the Champagne Marne Sector was awarded 70+ years late.</p>
<p>Two Massachusian NCOs died quite possibly of Spanish 'flu in October while out of line. (The rear and hospitals were actually worse for the 'flu, because that's where the sick people were.)</p>
<p>(Which brings us to the right end of the Line and the end of this tour of the line.)</p>
