join the 77th Div. when orders came for that division to go overseas, before the school course 
was completed. 
    Awarded D. S. C: "For extraordinary heroism in action near Haumont, France, November 
11, 1918. He led a platoon of machine guns and two one-pounder guns with their crews under 
cover of a fog within the enemy's wire, and attacked at close range a strong point held by 25 men 
and 10 machine guns. After this position had been reduced, concentrated machine-gun fire 
from the ranks forced Lieutenant Austin and his party to withdraw. Exposing himself in 
order to place his men under cover, he was mortally wounded, but he directed the dressing 
of the wounds of his men and their evacuation before he would accept any aid for himself. 
He died a few hours later." 

ABMC - "Early in November ... 
The Second Army was therefore ordered to keep close watch of the enemy for any indications of a withdrawal. 
At that time the Second Army front was held, in order from right to left, by the VI Corps with the 92d Division in line, the IV Corps with 7th and 28th in line, and the French XVII Corps with the American 33d Division in line.
... The nearest part of the sector held by the 28th Division was at the woods seen in the distance to the right."

"Haumont-lès-Lachaussée. This village was lightly held by the Germans following the St. Mihiel attack. The 42d, 89th and 37th Divisions raided it several times and the 28th Division occupied it on two different occasions; from October 24 to 29, and again from November 9 to 11."

Other 28th Div objectives -- 
"Bois de Dommartin. Located about 600 yards in front of the American lines after the St. Mihiel operation, this little wood was the scene of many small but bitter fights in which at different times the 89th, 37th and 28th Divisions, in that order, participated. It was occupied by the 28th Division on November 10 and held until after the Armistice."
"Dommartin-la-Chaussée.  Site of a large German supply depot. The town was in the main line of resistance of the Hindenburg Line. Attempts of the 28th Division to capture it on November 10 were defeated with considerable losses."
"Mon Plaisir Farm. A strongly organized place in the Hindenburg Line which was attacked at different times after the St. Mihiel offensive by the 78th and 7th Divisions. The 28th and 89th Divisions sent patrols to it. The farm was still in the hands of the Germans when the Armistice became effective."
"Marimbois Farm. This farm was in German hands at the close of the St. Mihiel offensive. From September 16 on patrols of the 42d and, later, of the 89th and 28th Divisions frequently clashed with the enemy there. It was occupied by the 28th Division on November 9 and held until the Armistice."

    Silver Star Citation 3 June, 1919: "For gallantry in action near Courmont, France, 4 Oct., 
1918, in burying the dead under heavy shell fire." 
    Cited in G. O. No. 26, 20 Nov., 1918: "For faithful and conscientious performance of duty 
and for extreme coolness under shell fire in the performance of his duty as Chief Burial Officer, 
5th Corps, during the Meuse-Argonne operations. ' 
    Croix de Guerre with palm: "During the advance from the Ourcq to the Vesle from July 31 
to Aug. 6, 1918, he carried out his duties heedless of danger and without interruption under a 
violent fire. By his comforting words and his fine example of abnegation and bravery he 
encouraged the men of his regiment who were advancing to the assault." 
    Recommended for D. S. C: "During the advance from Courmont to Mount St. Martin, 
Chaplain Davitt worked single-handed without ceasing for anything, collecting the dead 
of his Division (32d) and looking after the burial. He did this under violent fire, to which he 
apparently paid no attention. While doing this work he stopped to encourage with cheerful 
words and advice the enlisted men along the line who also were under fire. The results of 
his work were 125 American soldiers buried, many wounded cared for, and soldiers in the 
line encouraged." 
    Cited for bravery August 6, 1918, during operations along the Vesle River: "To rescue 40 
wounded soldiers who were temporarily isolated from their command, he led a party of vol- 
unteers through a hail of machine gun bullets. All were rescued and returned to their com- 
mand without the loss of a single man." 
   Cited for bravery Oct. 20, 1918, during the Argonne offensive: "To rescue three wounded sol- 
diers, he leaped over the top of the trench, and, under enemy machine-gun fire, dragged them 
to safety one by one." 
Name appears on Memorial Tablet, State House.
