# Massachusetts Great War Killed In Action on 11-11 ... after Armistice was signed but before cease fire 

The final attack on 11-11 morning is generally considered to be even more unnecessary slaughter. For #WW100 Armistice Day, let´s remember those cut down that day in particular. Since I'm sitting in Boston and I know the ME NG Historian has my home state of ME covered, I'll focus on Massachusians.

# SITREP & OOB 11-11

## Situation Report (SITREP) 10 & 11 Nov

After the success of the Sept-October Meuse-Argonne offensive, the allies reorganizing, and preparing for a final push to Metz (and perhaps the Rhine?). It was scheduled for mid November -- 14th in the center, 11th on the right.

![Plan of Proposed American-French Attack, Nov 14, 1918 (ABMC, Sect.3 p 115)](Nov-14-plan.v01.png "Nov 14 plan")


> "Early in November the Allied attacks, covering almost the entire front from the Meuse River to the North Sea, produced great disorganization in the German forces.
...
On November 9, while the Armistice negotiations were in progress, urgent orders were issued by Marshal Foch, the Allied Commander-in-Chief, directing that the enemy be pushed all along the Western Front and that be be given no time to rest or reorganize his troops." [^ABMC]

# Remembering Massachusetts Soldiers recorded KIA on 11-11 

This list is compiled from *GOLD STAR RECORD OF MASSACHUSETTS IN THE WORLD WAR ( Vol II)*[^MaCommGold], selecting only those Massachusians listed as Killed In Action (KIA; or Died of Wounds the same day) on 11-11, the date of Armistice, whose lives were sacrificed by Generals who knew Armistice was about to be or already signed, to make the point that Germany was defeated on the battlefield as well as "at home". (See e.g. [PPT Sapper thread](https://twitter.com/pptsapper/status/1060000294124314625)  and [lives-wasted](http://www.historynet.com/world-war-i-wasted-lives-on-armistice-day.htm).)

In order left to right on the line, since we only know time of day for two of these.

## GAF / French Army of Belgium ###

Two US divisions, 37th Div and 91st Div, and 53d Art.Bde, were operating under (respectively) Fr. XXXIV and Fr.XXX Corps, French Army of Belgium, Group of Armies Flanders / Grand Army of Flanders, King of Belgians in titular command (and the French Chief of Staff in de facto command), in Belgium, Ypres-Lys offensive, 28 Oct - 11 Nov.

Relatively few Massachusetts soldiers were in these units, so none KIA 11-11. Mass.Comm Gold Star report [^MaCommGold] lists earlier KIA with these units

* One 2LT O'Brien of Williamstown was awarded the **Silver Star** posthumous for actions in October; 
* another 2LT, J A Kelly, **Belgian Croix de Guerre** posthumous; 
* one killed crossing Scarpe River Nov 2; one veteran Sergeant died of disease, having been gassed; 
* another killed in Belgium; an Engineer, died of wounds from prior offensive; 
* several others KIA or Died of Wounds in earlier offensives, but none 11-11.

## BEF/CEF, Belgium (CG Haig) ###

Allied Left Wing liberating Belgium (GAF and BEF) includes CANADIAN CORPS.

### BEF, Br. I Army (CG Horne) , 2nd or 3rd Canadian Div?

#### Harry Douglas MacAlpine

Our first entry is a bit of a mystery.

> **MacAlpine, Harry Douglas, Sapper,** C. E. F.: killed in action 11 Nov., 1918. 

> Enl. 25 Feb., 1917, 1st W. S. Royal Engrs., Canadian Army. 

> Born 2 March, 1887, at Bear River, N. S., son of Henry Judson and Luvenia (Hill) MacAlpine; 
> brother of William Edward and Alfred Freeman (1st Lieut., M. C). Married Josephine Sinnott 
> (deceased). Child: Walter Francis. Cousin of Edward E. Nickles, page 352. 

> (Mass.Comm.Gold-Star narrative [^MaCommGold])


A Greater Bostonian (apparently of Somerville, listed under Middelsex County), possibly with a Nova Scotian wife and other Nova Scotian connections, enlists in **Canadian Royal Engineers**. I haven decoded ´1st W.S.' but Canadian memorial records assign Sapper H.D.MacAlpine to **"Inland Water Transport" (IWT)** which is under/grouped as "Inland Waterway and Docks" (IW&D, sometimes IWTD), which includes narrow-gauge RR and canal-barge ambulances & hospital ships, as well as cargo barging for RE.  Classed as "Imperial service outside CEF" in some Canadian statistics, so apparently CRE outside of Division combat engineer Co's seems to be slurped into BEF RE?  IWT/IW&D would be Horizontal Engineering or Service of Supply in our nomenclature?

He is sometimes indexed as McAlpine. Only the Mass.Commission[^MaCommGold] source says KIA, others say Unknown or died of war only, very unclear.

> Buried: Longuenesse (St Omer) Souvenir Cemetery, Pas de Calais, France, V. E. 52.
(multiple sources)

Unknown where he died on on 11-11, or what unit he was with; quite logically it would be Canadian Corps in BEF taking Mons on 11-11, but could be with CEF in Siberia, or elsewhere with RE or other BEF troops. (RE IWT was very active in Mesopotamia and Italy.)

If he fell at Mons, as is somewhat likely for a Canadian KIA on 11-11, it likely to be 2nd Div or 3rd Div, notionally in Canadian Corps. Troops in Mons were 7th CIB (RCR, PPCLI, 42d Montréal Bn, and 49th Bn). Only 1 KIA in city, named, not this one, but could have been on approach?

His (C)RE specialty IWT was supposedly (partially? wholy?) drafted into Durham Light Infantry(DLI), also near Mons but rotated out??

* [RootsWeb, Nova Scotia Vital Statisics](http://sites.rootsweb.com/~canbrnep/vitstat1913.htm) deepens the mystery by presenting a different possible spouse or someone of same name in same county, also with Canadian connections: 

> **Severance, Annie Love,** d/o Mrs. Margaret Elizabeth Severance married at Melrose, Mass., 19 April 1913, to **Harry Douglas MacAlpine,** Somerville, Mass., s/o Henry MacAlpine. [8 May 1913 write up]
> - *The Register,* Berwick, Kings Co., Nova Scotia - 1913 Vital Statistics Published on Thursday"

Regarding IWT, we find

> In April 1918, Canadians with the Royal Engineers Inland Water Transport were drafted to the Durham Light Infantry ...
> *Filling the Ranks: Manpower in the Canadian Expeditionary Force* [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0773549102], Richard Holt, 2017

which is confirmed by [6th Bn Durham Light Inf.](https://archive.org/stream/6thbattaliondur00ainuoft/6thbattaliondur00ainuoft_djvu.txt) getting a draft from RE IWT&D, but that Bn was reduced to Cadre and distributed to other Bns by 6 Nov, so nowhere in particular on 11-11. 

[Durhams History](https://archive.org/details/cihm_991347/page/n407) says Durhams were in reserve from 8 Nov, so not at Mons, any 11-11 battle dead in Durhams would be died of earlier wounds (or detached to a unit one-line, or hit be deep zone harassment).

So we don´t know where Harry served or fell; lucky to have any information on a Bostonian serving with Canadians and Brits at all, it seems.


### BEF, Br.IV Army (CG Rawlinson)

US 30th Div and 27th Div are in Army Reserve and do not figure in 11-11 KIA story.


## French Army Group of Rupture/Reserve, Fr.3rd Army 

Possibly two US Regiments 59th and 370th, in line?  Unclear map legend!

## French Army Group Center - None


## AEF, (US) FIRST ARMY, V CORPS (1-77-2-89)

V Corps holds the left of 1st Army, adjacent to GAC, Fr.IV Army, which has a fresh Fr.70th Div at its right corner.

CG Summerall, appointed in 2nd Army reorg Oct 12th, was rather aggressive. (See [lives-wasted](http://www.historynet.com/world-war-i-wasted-lives-on-armistice-day.htm) for more on him and 11-11.)

#### Charles Sylvester Hart (Medical Corps)

> Hart, Charles Sylvester: killed in action 11 Nov., 1918 [in attack along the Meuse between Muzon  and Inor]. 

> Enl. 26 Sept., 1917, R. A., Medical Dept., Fort Ethan Allen; trans. 20 Nov., 1917, to Med. Dept.,  Base Hospital 66; 19 July, 1918, to Medical Detachment, 2d Engrs., 2d Div. Overseas 18 Dec, 1917. 

> Born 15 June, 1897, at Newbury, N. H., son of Fred S. (deceased) and Hannah S. (Muzzey) Hart  of Holyoke, 1926; brother of Clarence F. Jeweler. Square at Lancaster, N. H., named in his memory. 

> (Mass.Comm.Gold-Star narrative [^MaCommGold])

From the information given, we can not tell where along 2nd Div's line Medic Hart fell, but it's a narrow line.

Division history says -

> "Nov 10-11, elements of the Div cross
the Meuse east of the Bois de l'Hospice and reach the heights south
of Moulins, the north and south ridge through Senegal Fme, and
Warmonterne Fme." [CMH-23-2] 

### 89th Div

A Mass. solder originally with 89th is reported KIA in sector of 26th Div, so q.v.26th below.

The movements of his original unit just for completeness, and since there are good photos from their stretch of the Meuse.
 
> "Nov 2-5, Div advances through Barricourt, Tailly,
Nouart, Beauclair, and Beaufort, reaching the Meuse from Laneuville-sur-Meuse to Pouilly. 
Nov 7, Div relieves units of the 2d Div as far as a point south of Létanne. 
Nov 10, units cross the Meuse west of Pouilly and reach the high ground north of that place. 
Nov 11, divisional units cross the Meuse at Laneuville-sur-Meuse, occupy Stenay and a position northeast thereof; units on the left of the Div occupy the Bois de Hache and Autreville." [^CMH-23-2]

#### (Rev) 1LT William F. Davitt Chaplain - **0945 AM** 

**0945 AM** - Armistice was already signed, 11 am cessation already announced.

> **Davitt, William F., First Lieutenant, Chaplain:** killed in action 11 Nov., 1918, near Ecurey, 75 minutes before the armistice. 

>   Commissioned 1st Lieut., Chaplain, 6 Jan., 1918, and assigned to 120th M.G. Bn., 32d Div.; trans, to 125th Inf., 32d Div. He had volunteered as Chaplain, K. of C, at outbreak of war, and was assigned Oct., 1917, to Camp McArthur, Tex. Overseas 10 Feb., 1918. 

>   Born 8 Dec, 1886, at Holyoke, son of Lawrence (born in Canada) and Mary (Kane, born in Ireland, died 1920) Davitt; brother of James L. (1st Lieut., 94th Aero Sq., A. E. F.) of Willimansett.

W., Chicopee, named in his honor, also Fr. Davitt Council, K. of C, Lenox, and a square in Worcester. 

>    **Silver Star** Citation 3 June, 1919: "For gallantry in action near Courmont, France, 4 Oct., 1918, in burying the dead under heavy shell fire." 

>    **Cited in G. O. No. 26,** 20 Nov., 1918: "For faithful and conscientious performance of duty  and for extreme coolness under shell fire in the performance of his duty as **Chief Burial Officer, 5th Corps,** during the Meuse-Argonne operations. ' 

>    **Croix de Guerre with palm:** "During the advance from the Ourcq to the Vesle from July 31 
to Aug. 6, 1918, he carried out his duties heedless of danger and without interruption under a 
violent fire. By his comforting words and his fine example of abnegation and bravery he 
encouraged the men of his regiment who were advancing to the assault." 
79
>    Recommended for D. S. C: "During the advance from Courmont to Mount St. Martin, 
Chaplain Davitt worked single-handed without ceasing for anything, collecting the dead 
of his Division (32d) and looking after the burial. He did this under violent fire, to which he 
apparently paid no attention. While doing this work he stopped to encourage with cheerful 
words and advice the enlisted men along the line who also were under fire. The results of 
his work were 125 American soldiers buried, many wounded cared for, and soldiers in the 
line encouraged." 

>    Cited for bravery August 6, 1918, during operations along the Vesle River: "To rescue 40 
wounded soldiers who were temporarily isolated from their command, he led a party of vol- 
unteers through a hail of machine gun bullets. All were rescued and returned to their com- 
mand without the loss of a single man." 

>   Cited for bravery Oct. 20, 1918, during the Argonne offensive: "To rescue three wounded soldiers, he leaped over the top of the trench, and, under enemy machine-gun fire, dragged them  to safety one by one."

the Second Army in the event of a German retirement on its front. Because of the Austrian
Armistice. new dispositions were being ended by the enemy between the Meuse and Moselle
Rivers. General Pershing, on November 5, ordered the Second Army to advance between the
Moselle River and Etang de Lachaussee towards Gorze and Chambley, in anticipation of a
probable enemy withdrawal which, in fact, got under way the next day."
