## Beaumont-en-Verdunois  ##

Beaumont-en-Verdunois is in the area where Fr XVII Corps was relieved by Fr II Colonial Corps; it was  liberated by Fr.26e Div, which was then relieved by US 26th Div. Beaumont was in the right-rear of US 26th Div at time of 1LT Wilson's death -- the opposite end of Yankee Div (26th) line from *Ville-devant-Chaumont* mentioned above. The Mass. Commission record shows him heading overseas with 356th Inf., 89th Div, but shows his location of death as Beaumont, in 26th Div´s area; was he transferred or detached to 26th? We don't know from records at hand. 


## Beaumont-en-Argonne ## 

Beaumont-en-Argonne  is shown on ABMC map of 2nd and 89th's Meuse crossings, west of Létanne and Pouill-sur-Meuse.

This would be the Beaumont in question for fellow from 89th.
