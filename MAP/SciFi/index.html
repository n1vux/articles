<p>The ?First? ?Second? Thesis on SciFi as LitCrit.</p>
<p>MIT graciously returned to M.A.P., in 2003, copyright to M.A.P.'s 1960 Bachelor's Thesis.</p>

<p>This was for 35 years presumed to be the first academic thesis on SciFi as LitCrit, but no, writer and <em>bonefide</em> academic James E Gunn (1923-2020) did his 1951 M.A. thesis first. (Had the Internet been available in 1960, a literature search would have found it, or at least the 1958 reference to it.) MAP's is likely still the earliest <em>Bachelors</em> Thesis or <em>MIT</em> thesis, and it centers <strong>Literary Merit</strong> right in the title.</p>
