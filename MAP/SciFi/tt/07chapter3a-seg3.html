				<P>It is
				as natural for a &quot;child&quot; to develop as it is for an
				idiot endowed with telepathic talents and sensitivities. Hence,
				Hip's reduction to a childlike state is a rich source of
				developmental incidents. His first step forward is when he shows
				concern for Janie's well-being and has her eat the breakfast
				which she had prepared for him, thus exhibiting an &quot;adult&quot;
				independence and sense of responsibility. We have already noted
				the expansion of his &quot;world,&quot; which may be looked on as
				development from circumscribed foetus to &quot;space-binding&quot;
				(Korzybski' s term) adult. On a structural note, when Hip gains
				recall of his memories the same phrase is used which had
				terminated the passage about him in Part One: &quot;It was on the
				anti-aircraft range that he found an answer, a dream, and a
				disaster.&quot;
				</P>
				<P>Still
				on the subject of development, it is a logical development to Hip
				that Homo Gestalt should have evolved. He becomes more mature,
				and develops an understanding of Man as an ethical creature. (The
				book's development of the idea of Man reflected in gestalt being
				is quite neat: Lone is the tool-user, Gerry the
				environment-conqueror, and Hip the giver of laws). Hip explains
				what he calls the &quot;ethos&quot; to Gerry, and the penultimate
				step in the development of the Gerry-gestalt is accomplished in
				the incorporation of Hip as the &quot;still, small voice.&quot;
				Almost immediately, the ultimate step is accomplished: they are
				incorporated into the community of gestalts. As a final touch to
				the development pattern, Gerry learns that the <I>&uuml;ber-gestalt</I>
				(which considers itself a part of humanity) is responsible for
				many of the acts of human progress. &quot;Here was one who had
				whistled a phrase to Papa Haydn, and here one who had introduced
				William Morris to the Rossettis . . . [and he saw] a drowsy Ford
				with his mind suddenly lit by the picture of a line of men facing
				a line of machines.&quot; (p. 232)
				</P>
				<P>A
				quotation above suggests a connection between the forming of
				&quot;alliances&quot; and the process of development--the Prodds
				took in Lone and became &quot;something different;&quot; Lone
				took in the kids and became &quot;something different&quot;; the
				use of &quot;took in&quot; is quite suggestive itself. The
				culminating alliance, or taking in, is the incorporation of the
				Gerry-gestalt into the <I>&uuml;ber-gestalt</I>. The theme of
				development is abetted, however, by a series of shifts of
				alliances--with anything around that happens to be wearing pants,
				for instance. Others are helpful, though partial,
				expedients--Janie, and the twins' running away, for instance. The
				very number and the progression of the alliances furnish a
				forceful picture of the process of development: First were Lone
				and Evelyn, ill-fated but a start for Lone toward further
				alliances; after being beaten by Mr. Kew, Lone is taken in by the
				Prodds; Lone eventually becomes aware of a sense of membership
				with them; Lone takes in the twins and Janie, then Baby; he
				learns from Baby about the desirability of the idiot-innocent
				merger; finally, for Lone, there is the alliance with Alicia Kew
				wherein she furnishes him with information, and he furnishes her
				with physical gratification (the alliance with Gerry is told by
				Gerry, hence not too important in the Lone scheme). Hip's
				alliance with the Army turns out to be unsatisfying, but Janie's
				with the twins is the first one in the book which leads to a
				feeling of happiness for the allies. Gerry forms a temporary
				alliance with Stern, which proves to be a curative one; the
				gestalt he reveals himself to be is, of course, the alliance
				which leads to the best end, and was even good when Lone, the
				kids, and Gerry were in the woods &quot;bleshing&quot;. (&quot;Lone
				said maybe it was a mixture of 'blending' and 'meshing,' but I
				don't think he believed that himself. It was a lot more than
				that.&quot; p. 94) The kids' alliance with Alicia is dangerous to
				them, mainly because she is so selfish--wanting them to &quot;be&quot;
				her children; even worse was the brief telepathic alliance Gerry
				formed accidentally with Alicia, which led to his &quot;Baby is
				three&quot; occlusion. Finally, Janie takes Hip in, and Hip is
				cured; then the gestalt takes Hip in and it is cured. The
				culmination has been mentioned, the grand alliance of gestalts.
				</P>
				<P>The
				merger of Hip into the Gerry-gestalt has been prepared for
				skillfully by means of a Gerry-Hip parallel which operates in
				terms of both form and content. They were introduced at the same
				time in Part One, and both dropped after one passage, each to
				receive a whole part about him subsequently. Both were rescued
				from dirt and hunger. (They both even get sick after being fed
				the first time by Janie.) Both have mental occlusions. Hip
				learned when he was a child that &quot;I was useless and the
				things I wanted were by definition useless&quot; (p. 213); Gerry
				just wanted to do what comes naturally--both lacked &quot;values.&quot;
				Janie wanted to show Gerry how Hip had decayed, rather than
				living up to his brightness and promise; when Gerry went
				manic-depressive (the term is used by Janie and Hip), the same
				process of decay was taking place. Finally, Hip draws the
				parallel overtly:
				</P>
				<BLOCKQUOTE>Listen
					to me, orphan boy, I am a hated boy too. You were persecuted; so
					was I ... Listen to me, Miss Kew's boy, you lost yourself for
					years until you went back and learned again. So did I. Listen to
					me, Gerry. You discovered that no matter how great your power,
					nobody wanted it. So did I. You want to be wanted. You want to
					be needed. So do I. [p. 228]
					</P>
				</BLOCKQUOTE>
				<P>&quot;Multiplicity
				is our first characteristic; unity our second&quot; Gerry learns
				at the end. The unity is, of course, achieved through the process
				of what I have called alliances or mergers. In a sense, the
				process is &quot;physicalized&quot; through touching, or physical
				contact; e.g., if the idiot and the innocent &quot;so much as
				touch&quot; they will be changed. Instead of listing all the
				touch images, I shall merely mention one, and note that the rest
				can all be considered to be the mechanism for various of the
				mergers. The call Evelyn &quot;sends&quot; to Lone is worth
				mentioning. It becomes, to him, &quot; <I>Touch me, touch me</I>.&quot;
				The importance of touching is played up through a song Evelyn
				sings (p. 11) about touches which horrifies Alicia, the fact that
				the Kews &quot;don't touch one another,&quot; and the whipping
				Lone gets as a result of his having touched Evelyn. The emphasis
				and repetition of touching are a cue; they would not, it seems,
				be there unless there were some necessity in terms of the work as
				a whole--and necessity there is, as explained just above.
				</P>
				<P>Another
				group of elements relating to the theme of development are those
				pertaining to communication. Lone develops the power of
				communication with the Prodds, enabling him to become &quot;human.&quot;
				Janie can communicate with Baby, enabling the gestalt to form.
				The psychiatric process is accomplished through Gerry's
				communicating his problems to Stern, and in overcoming his
				occlusion he is able, in a sense, to regain communication with
				his memory. Stern, by the way, notes at some length the human
				failing of inability to communicate. Miss Kew wouldn't even talk
				to Gerry until he mentioned Lone. Hip thinks at Gerry, and
				communicates to him his conclusions about morality. And finally,
				on the incorporation with the <I>&uuml;ber-gestalt</I>, there is
				&quot;happy and fearless communion.&quot; (p. 231)
				</P>
				<P>The
				concept of morality is not sprung upon the reader at the end of
				the development of the communication. It, too, undergoes a form
				of development in the incidents relating to moral issues. For
				instance. when Gerry and Lone were stealing food and Gerry took a
				bright yellow ball point pen, Lone made him put it back, saying
				&quot;We only take what we need.&quot; (p. 96) There is a
				rudimentary sense of morality here, but Gerry does not
				comprehend: &quot;morality&quot; must be a conscious thing, and
				in his case a learned one. Stern's explanation of Gerry's
				loneliness is in terms of Gerry's lack of morality, and once
				again Gerry does not understand what is meant. With Hip the case
				is altogether different. His very name, which we finally learn is
				from Hippocrates, suggests the rather highly developed moral code
				of the Hippocratic oath. Also, he is called prissy on numerous
				occasions and quotes Scripture at least once. The merging of the
				amoral Gerry and the over-moral Hip is an instance of the
				dialectic process (which is the form of most of the
				communication: question, answer, new question ...): embarassment
				with unconcern into a proper outlook.
				</P>
				<P>Janie
				brought Hip to Gerry so that Gerry might learn to be ashamed, so
				that he might see how Hip's original brightness and promise have
				been prostituted. The parallel between Gerry and Hip suggests, of
				course, that this is the same thing which has happened to the
				gestalt. Hip understands what Janie wants. He realizes that
				&quot;Morals: they're nothing but a coded survival instinct!&quot;
				(p. 220) But they apply to an individual in a society. What Gerry
				needs, having at this stage no society of which to be a member,
				is what Hip defines as an &quot;ethos,&quot; a code for species
				survival. He over-comes Gerry physically, with the help of the
				twins. However, he realizes that the moral act of killing a
				&quot;monster&quot; is superseded by the ethical act of allowing
				the species to progress in the &quot;superman.&quot; He then
				frees Gerry and places himself in his power. Gerry extracts his
				thoughts and <I>is</I> ashamed. This accomplished, the
				<I>&uuml;ber-gestalt</I> is able to contact Gerry and explain to
				him the final stage of the development--the humanistic ethic
				which regards the gestalts as a part of humanity, revering
				humanity as its parent, and a partner in the progress of the
				human race.
				</P>
				<P>The
				final area of development suggested by incidents is that of
				&quot;authority,&quot; or power. Kew loses his authority to Lone,
				who in turn loses his temporarily to the Prodds. The Prodds lose
				their authority to Lone, who also gains authority over the kids
				(who had usurped authority from their respective parents). Due to
				Lone's, and later Gerry's, weakness, Baby is actually the boss of
				the gestalt in its initial phases. Alicia's attempt to take over
				causes Gerry to kill her, but before he can assert himself he
				must temporarily cede the authority to Stern. Janie rebels
				against Gerry's misuse of his authority, and enables Hip to
				become dominant. Hip's tenure is brief, but useful; and when he
				relinquishes the power to Gerry, Gerry immediately acknowledges
				the authority of the <I>&uuml;ber-gestalt</I>. But the
				<I>&uuml;ber-gestalt</I> is guided by the ethos, so the final
				authority rests where it should, with the philosophical sanction
				of humanism.
				</P>
				<P>In
				terms of images, the theme of development is implemented in three
				major areas. First is Nature and natural images, which are linked
				throughout with growth and shelter. The drives mentioned earlier
				are an example. Also, Prodd's being a farmer, a grower of things,
				relates to his developing Lone. Lone waits in the woods for
				completion, and the original dwelling of the gestalt was a
				covered-over hut-cave in a mountain. Hip's investigation of
				&quot;natural&quot; phenomena (the strange behavior of proximity
				fuses over the area which turned out to have the anti-gravity
				device in it) leads him to Gerry. These and other instances of
				natural images culminate in the description of the <I>&uuml;ber-gestalt</I>
				as &quot;a laughing thing with a human heart and a reverence for
				its human origins, smelling of sweat and new-turned earth rather
				than suffused with the pale odor of sanctity.&quot; (p. 233) The
				major theme of development or completion is a natural process,
				and in the context of the book, Nature is a good thing.
				</P>
				<P>A
				second area of imagery which suggests development is that of
				animal images. Lone's progression from description as animal to
				description as human being has already been noted. Throughout,
				the animal nature of people is treated as a bad thing. Alicia
				makes sounds like a goose's honking. Gerry lived like a sewer
				rat. Janie describes the gestalt's lot as being like living on a
				desert island with a herd of goats. She felt human when she
				thought of Hip as a big glossy stallion or a bantam rooster when
				she first saw him, suggesting that the divorcement is between
				humanity and low animality but that proud and noble animals have
				something in common with what humans should be. There are many
				other uses of animal imagery; as a matter of fact, probably more
				than any other type. However, the only other instance I should
				like to cite is the death of Prodd's horse: Let us note that its
				death impels Lone to build the anti-gravity generator which in
				turn brings Hip into the picture. That is, it serves as a very
				important causal link in the overall process of development.
				</P>
				<P>The
				anti-gravity device and its importance suggest the final area of
				imagery I shall note here: technological images. Hip's attempts
				to progress through making various electronic gadgets are
				failures. Lone's helping Prodd push the truck out of the mud
				causes Prodd to call him a hydraulic jack. Baby is like an adding
				machine. The initial description Lone offers Alicia of the
				gestalt is in terms of radio transmitters and receivers. For the
				most part I believe that a negative value (because the
				descriptions are among the group of faulty assumptions) is being
				attached to dehumanized technology. Lone needs an ax with which
				to build a shelter, and this is all right; but when Hip plays
				games with an elevator's control panel, he gets in trouble.
				</P>
				<P>At
				first blush, it may appear surprising to find technology cast in
				a bad light in a science fiction story. Having read Chapter I,
				the reader will not, I hope, be shocked. The point is that a view
				of &quot;hardware&quot; technology as possibly inimical to
				humanity is both philosophically plausible, and biologically
				necessary in the scheme of hypotheses which underlies  <I>More
				Than Human</I>, which is not at all guilty of the charges of
				Scientism or plumping for technological progress at all costs. It
				is, rather, a concrete instance of the humanism of which I
				believe modern science fiction is &quot;guilty.&quot; The
				&quot;technological impact upon Society&quot; definition of
				science fiction cuts both ways, and the possibility that
				technology may be biologically bad (for the mind should be used
				rather than the gadget) is just as valid a basis for a work as
				are the sociological ills which technology abets in  <I>Brave New
				World</I>,  <I>1984</I>, or  <I>The Big Ball of Wax</I>. And to the
				reader who actively agrees with humanism,  <I>More Than Human</I>
				is more satisfying than the satires just mentioned which endorse
				a humanistic approach only passively, through condemning the
				opposite approach of one form or another of tyranny.
				</P>
				<P>To
				return from the digression, I believe that any further
				enumeration of objective factors from the novel would be of
				little purpose. The aspect of Complexity could be further traced
				out, to be sure, but the major inter-relations have been
				indicated, and further attempts on my part to point out
				complexities would take us into the area of personal opinion and
				&quot;free association,&quot; thus irritating rather than
				enlightening the reader. To sum up before turning to a discussion
				of Beardsleyan Affective Reasons for liking  <I>More Than Human</I>,
				we have seen that it is quite tightly unified, and highly
				complex. The unity of the book lies in its major theme of
				Development to Completion (which is unification itself, as a
				matter of fact)--which arises from the interplay of the opposed
				themes of Incompleteness and Progress. Further, the unity is
				supported by the formal aspects of the book, for instance the
				<I>method</I> of incomplete revelation as supporting and adding
				to the <I>theme</I> of Incompleteness.</P>
