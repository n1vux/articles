				<h3 align=center>Abstract</h3>
				<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
				<P>Science
				fiction has been considered by many critics to be strictly a
				&quot;pulp&quot; field, containing works which are designed
				solely for entertainment and of no serious literary value. I
				contend that science fiction is <I>more</I> than pulp; the
				contention is supported as follows: The existing criticism of the
				field in general is surveyed and cross-criticized, with the
				conclusion that the content of science fiction is acceptable, but
				the literary form must be investigated in particular works as
				generalizations on the subject are profitless. The criteria for
				making literary judgments are briefly treated, in order to
				determine the conventional indicators of &quot;literary merit.&quot;
				Finally, five &quot;close readings&quot; are offered, three of
				which support the claim that science fiction works <I>do</I>
				possess literary merit, and two of which further support the
				conclusions as to the content of science fiction reached in the
				first part.
