				on Form and Discontent</B></FONT></FONT></P>
				<P>&nbsp;</P>
				<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Just as no good deed goes unpunished, a
				strong case can also be made that no religiously motivated act
				doesn't wind up punishing somebody ... sometimes more than once.</FONT></P>
				<P><FONT FACE="Arial">That insight stems from the consequences of
				my somewhat reluctant, but on the whole well motivated, decision
				to allow myself to be talked into using &quot;cascading style
				sheets&quot; in order to be able to exercise more control over
				how readers will see the results of all this foolishness. As
				mentioned in the &quot;About&quot; section, the decision was made
				because my old friend Bill convinced me that there were good
				technotheological reasons for doing it. That is, on &quot;Religious&quot;
				grounds, several <i>apparent</i> HTML mechanisms (i.e.,
insiders such as Bill know it turns out that they aren't real
				HTML mechanisms, in that they aren't actually approved, official
				aspects of the HTML specification) that <i>might</i> be used to control
				appearance ought to be shunned because they turn out to have been
				invented by either the Evil Empire itself (no, sports fans, not
				the Bronx Bastids; the Redmond Ratfinks, in this context) or one
				of its onetime competitors and forced on the public in
				cardtrickster fashion to drum up business for themselves by
being incompatible with the competitor's browser, thus promoting their own browser
if and when they're incautiously adopted by "content providers".</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">(Speaking of theses, there might well be an interesting Business Ethics
Master's in the analysis of which is the more sleazy, the HTML sabotage by the software swine
or the insertion of "chips" to prevent generic ink cartridges' being used in printers by the
hardware swine ... if "Business Ethics" weren't at best an oxydullnormal in first place, anyway.
 And while I'll resist the temptation to
				launch into a sermon on the topic of the Evils of defacing other
				people's art in order to promote one's own profit, those
				interested might well spend some time thinking about that very
				point, to their profit, as it were.)
</font></p>
 <P><FONT FACE="Arial">So not
				wanting to give aid and comfort to the enemy, once that had been
				explained to me I replied with something along the lines of &quot;Oh,
				I didn't know it was Technotheological&quot; and wound up going
				to what turned out to be a great deal of trouble to retrofit
				cascading style sheets to the HTML version of the thesis that
				existed at the time.  That turned out to be the first punishment.</FONT></P>
				<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Skip ahead to a day or two before I'd
				planned to do the mass mailing to announce that The Thesis was at
				last available for viewing. That's when Bill discovered
				that in the particular browser he was using for checking out the
				final version (at my request, as a &quot;beta test&quot;), things
				didn't look right at all. Lines were squnched together,
				italicized words were overstruck and messy in general, and
				something funny happened to most of the margins, to name only
				those glitches which come to mind at the moment. To run close to
				the ragged edge of being the sort of person who bites heads off
				chickens as part of his circus act, what happened was he was
				using Netscape 4.70 [or maybe 4.73] as one of his testing tools,
				whereas I had been using Netscape 4.79 as one of mine, and the
				latter, while it didn't exactly do the style sheets stuff right,
				didn't make things look ridiculously bad, so I was willing to settle.</FONT></P>
				<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Figuring out what to do about that
				occasioned me a great deal of concern and wasted a fair amount of
				time until I got lucky and discovered once I fired up an older
				version of Netscape I happened to have around, &quot;for
				completeness&quot;, that if JavaScript were not enabled--which
				is, in fact, the state I usually keep it in, having been against
				JavaScript on religious grounds well before I was converted to
				the cascading style sheets persuasion--the bad behavior ceased.
				So you might think the principle should merely be that few
				religious acts don't wind up punishing somebody, but it turns out
				that there were other anomalies that even turning JavaScript off
				didn't &quot;work around&quot; and I wound up having to
				remove the stylesheets after all.  Second punishment.  And then, of course, there was
				one more anomaly that required putting a highly abbreviated
				stylesheet back in, at the cost of still more time, energy, and
				stress on both sundry body parts and what's left of my
				mind.  Third punishment.</FONT></P>
				<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Who knows whether I've fixed all the
				funnies.  By Murphy's Law, almost certainly not.  At any
				rate, aside from presenting the opening philosophical insight,
				the other reason for bothering with this digression is a desire
				to let you know that I know that &quot;your smileage may vary&quot;,
				as I like to paraphrase the techie cliche'. In other words, I've
				done all I could bring myself to do to smooth things out, but
				your quality of viewing experience will depend a great deal on
				which browser you're using. You probably should already know that
				browsers matter, I daresay, but since not everybody who reads The
				Thesis will be an experienced computer user, it seemed worth
				stating explicitly.</FONT></P>
				<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Semifinally, as might but shouldn't go
				without saying, I do of course offer my apologies to those of you
				who turn out not to have a browser that does let you see the
				document in a reasonably clean fashion.  Here's hoping, though,
				that the resulting viewing experience won't wind up being too
				unsatisfactory for too many readers....  (Note well that I'm
				only talking about your reactions to the Form; nothing I can do
				about how you react to the Content other than to remind you The
				Thesis itself was written more than 43 years ago, as I digress in
				December of 2003.)</FONT></P>
				<P><FONT FACE="Arial">And as perhaps could and should go without
				saying, if you have a fairly &quot;new&quot; browser,
				presentation sorts of things should work out all right. But as is
				in fact quite well worth saying, if it's an &quot;Internet
				Explorer&quot; version you're using, new or old, other,
				non-presentation, things might well work out very badly ... since
				security flaws in &quot;IE&quot; are arguably the most-exploited
				avenues of attack by &quot;hackers&quot;. So think about that,
				too. (I call it Innernut Extorter, myself; but I did check The
				Thesis out--while not connected to the 'Net, of course--with a
				copy of IE5, I guess it was, I never got around to deleting, and
				another &quot;beta-tester&quot; used IE6, and at least those two
				cybersieves do appear to give the &quot;look&quot; I want,
				finally ... even though it was for Innernut's sake that I
				had to reintroduce the skeletal stylesheets--as what I dearly
				hope will prove to be the final punishment for the original
				religiously motivated action.)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Not to leave you with the wrong impression, though, please don't get
me wrong: Some technotheological Holy Wars <i>are</i> worth fighting, irrespective of punishment.
  The Us (righteous adherants of TCP/IP-based internetting, rooted in the sacred, properly Descriptive, ARPANET 
Reference Model--a/k/a the Old Network Boys) vs. Them (deluded worshippers of the diabolical,
obscenely Prescriptive, "ISO Reference Model"--a/k/a the ISORMites) one comes immediately
to mind.  Even if I would have made a lot more money off The Book (despite only getting royalties
on every other copy sold) if I'd been able to bring myself to sup with the Devil....</font></p>
