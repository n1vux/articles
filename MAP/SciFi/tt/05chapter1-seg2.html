							&quot;Philosophical &quot; Arguments
							</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
							<P>I
							am unable to resist picking on Mr. Priestly once more, for
							contrary to his notions about the lack of &quot;philosophy&quot;
							in science fiction there is a very large amount of discussion
							by other critics about the philosophical content and the
							philosophical implications of science fiction, as well as
							discussion of the content of science fiction in general. I am
							calling all such objections to content and its implications
							&quot;philosophical,&quot; in order to distinguish it from the
							&quot;artistic&quot; objections--those which take issue with
							<I>how</I> the content is presented, not <I>what</I> it is
							saying. The broad problem has been given the rather catchy
							label of &quot;Idea as Hero&quot; by Amis. The importance of
							ideas in science fiction is well-taken, especially if we keep
							his two provisos more firmly in mind than his emphasis would
							require: first, that the idea need not be a technological
							advance; second, and more important, that the class of stories
							which have ideas as heroes does <I>not</I> comprise the whole
							of science fiction. Satire, adventure for the sake of
							adventure, and even concern with individuals as people in
							future-projected milieus, all fall outside the grouping.
							</P>
							<P>One
							aspect of &quot;idea as hero&quot; is the notion that the
							extrapolations found in science fiction can be of value.
							Campbell is so concerned with science fiction as &quot;prophecy&quot;
							that he thinks that &quot;classical literary values do not
							touch on&quot; science fiction because it is &quot;so
							concerned with prophecy.&quot;[19] He is more temperate
							elsewhere, speaking of science fiction's providing a &quot;practice
							area&quot; for manipulating ideas which are &quot;no practice&quot;
							in the real world (e.g., world-annihilating nuclear
							weapons).[20] Here the value can be detected: Amis speaks of
							the solving of future problems on the last page of his book;
							Campbell says, &quot;Since something's going to happen [in the
							future], we might as well take a little trouble and see what
							'somethings' might happen, and select one that suits us.&quot;[21]
							As usual, the point does not apply to all science fiction, but
							is simply one of many points which can be raised in defense of
							the notion that it has value, in this case an intellectual,
							&quot;cognitive&quot; value. And Campbell to the contrary, the
							value of science fiction as prophecy can be distinctly
							enhanced by conforming, wherever possible, to &quot;classical
							literary values,&quot; as witness the great impact of  <I>Brave
							New World</I> on readers in general. Granted the Huxley &quot;name&quot;
							has something to do with it, but he got the name somewhere,
							and the somewhere was from critics who decided that he did
							conform to the normal critical criteria. The point is that
							there could well be authors for whom their association with
							science fiction, and the field's bad critical odor, are the
							only barriers between them and similar critical acclaim. The
							value of ideas for the future is not
							inconsiderable--especially when they can be applied to the
							present. To present a classical literary claim, I would urge
							the consideration of the science fiction author in his
							just-discussed role as problem-solver and idea-generator as
							fulfilling Shelley's dictum that the poet/artist is the
							unacknowledged legislator of mankind.
							</P>
							<P>Another
							aspect of ideas as heroes is the issue of satire. Most of the
							critics admit that science fiction is a common vehicle for
							satire; in his article cited below, though, Michaelson claims
							that he finds the satire &quot;too pessimistic.&quot; In
							opposition to his view, Treguboff found social criticism in 68
							per cent of the stories in her sample, and solutions offered
							in 64 per cent, so the satire would seem to be
							non-pessimistic, in the general or &quot;average&quot; story.
							When pessimism <I>is</I> found, it is not without certain
							philosophical justifications to commend it: In the first place
							is the issue of simple verisimilitude; for instance, the
							captive audience of  <I>The Big Ball of Wax</I> is something
							which could happen; the death of the Savage in  <I>Brave New
							World</I> is something which would happen in the circumstances
							described--and they are, in turn, quite possible on the basis
							of affairs of today.</P>
							<P>The
							second justification of &quot;pessimistic&quot; satire is the
							question of the moral consequences of satirical science
							fiction: A sufficiently frightening description of the future
							consequences of present folly may serve as a deterrent to the
							folly; witness  <I>On The Beach</I>, a novel about the ultimate
							doom of the human race in the after-radiation of an atomic
							war: the Boston showing of the movie version was picketed by
							people sufficiently aroused by it to want to protest nuclear
							testing. As a further note on the subject of pessimism,
							poetess Rosalie Moore objects to the &quot;downbeat&quot;
							quality of so-called mainstream writing, and finds science
							fiction to be far more optimistic.[22] Her generalization
							comes closer to being accurate, I have the feeling, than many
							of the ones in regard to science fiction, both pro and
							con--not that any generalization holds completely, but some
							cover more cases than others.
							</P>
							<P>Pessimism
							aside, let us return to satire in general. Satire can be a
							valuable thing. In the Brettnor symposium, Asimov plumps for
							what he calls &quot;social science fiction,&quot; which
							amounts essentially to what I have been calling satire. (He
							claimed in a recent straight science article that all his puns
							are intentional so I imagine we can read in a pause after
							social or run it on into social science as we prefer.) His
							point is that the &quot;branch of literature which is
							concerned with the impact of scientific advance upon human
							beings&quot; can make the contribution to society &quot;of
							accustoming its readers to the thought of the inevitability of
							continuing change and the necessity of directing and shaping
							that change rather than opposing it blindly or blindly
							permitting it to overthrow us.&quot;[23]
							</P>
							<P>Sociologists
							S. Finer and Oscar Shaftel[24,25] are examples of friendly
							trend hounds. Finer finds only a small proportion of social
							criticism, but being English he is not reading exactly the
							same market Treguboff sampled. He even finds a &quot;high
							degree of social significance in the mere fact that a large
							number of people today like ingenuity for ingenuity's sake,&quot;
							the &quot;display of intellectual ingenuity&quot; type being
							his second category of stories-- &quot;simple adventure&quot;
							the first. Shaftel, writing in &quot;A Marxian Quarterly,&quot;
							has more obvious vested interests and says that the &quot;greatest
							service&quot; of science fiction is satire, of which there is
							little to be found elsewhere. Even Amis, elsewhere calling
							vociferously for an &quot;invasion from above&quot; (implying,
							no doubt, that we will shortly be graced by an Amis science
							fiction opus) and concluding with the observation that there
							are a few competent &quot;minor writers&quot; in the field who
							should serve as examples to bring &quot;into existence the
							figure of real standing&quot; (himself?), puts in a good word
							here and there for satire.
							</P>
							<P>Campbell
							points out in  <I>Saturday Review</I> (note 19) that the
							projected societies are not necessarily endorsed by the
							authors. &quot;A mother can tell her child exactly what will
							happen if he sticks his hand in the fire [aha! a Moses myth];
							that doesn't mean she <I>wants</I> it to happen.&quot;
							Unfortunately, by taking satire and social criticism to heart,
							too literally, some people's feelings are liable to get hurt.
							Just as the Marxian &quot;outs&quot; are delighted to find
							criticism of any sort because they believe that constructive
							criticism must run in their direction, the vested interests of
							the &quot;ins&quot; are joggled by satire of existing trends,
							or, even worse, institutions. It is little surprise, then, to
							note that the major attack on science fiction as purveyor of
							Scientism appeared in  <I>Catholic World</I>.[26] The title was
							&quot;The Cult of Science Fiction&quot; and the argument was,
							in essence, that science fiction preaches Scientism and
							Scientism is terrible stuff. Now perhaps any non-devotional
							literature is a bad thing to some people, but science fiction
							doesn't seem all that much worse than most. In the first
							place, Scientism may not even be there. Treguboff's figures
							show 59 per cent of solutions to social criticisms as being
							accomplished through the social sciences, and as I remember it
							the physical sciences are the ones which are supposed to be
							the hotbeds of Scientism. Further, Arthur S. Barron, in the
							 <I>Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists</I>,[27]thinks that
							scientists read science fiction primarily for the
							&quot;glamorization of the scientist&quot; they find, <I>but
							also</I> because science fiction is a &quot;protest against
							the use of scientific knowledge and technology for anti-human
							ends, &quot; <I>and finally</I> to find a &quot;reaffirmation
							of basic values&quot; (Intellect, orderly universe, and
							universality of scientific method). Curious values, perhaps,
							but scarcely an attack on the church in the vein of a
							Voltairian &quot;<I>ecrasez l'infame</I>&quot; feud. Even such
							a stolid pillar of society as Mr. Fadiman speaks hopefully of
							science fiction's coping with (not proselytizing for) the
							problems of what Asimov called the impact of scientific
							advance. The whole Scientism issue seems to be simply a
							question of where one's vested interests lie.
							</P>
							<P>Claire
							Holcomb summed matters up on the subject of what I have been
							calling, quite broadly, the satirical aspects of science
							fiction, saying that &quot;When dignified by time, literary
							prestige, or philosophical pretension, critics call this kind
							of science fiction [prototypified by More, Swift, Butler,
							Huxley, etc.] --if optimistic--utopian, if
							pessimistic--satire.&quot;[28]
							</P>
							<P>A
							far more agreeable charge than that of Scientism was made by
							Finer. He detects a uniformity of the objects of attack:[29]
							</P>
							<BLOCKQUOTE>Caste
								societies governed by closed ruling cliques...They [the
								science fiction writers] invisage docile populations...unlike
								Huxley and Orwell, their stories end on an optimistic note;
								but their fears are the same<I>. </I>Indeed, their common
								characteristic is liberal humanism.
								</P>
							</BLOCKQUOTE>
							<P>The
							important notion is that of &quot;liberal humanism,&quot; of
							which the optimistic or &quot;upbeat&quot; endings he also
							notes are a concomitant. In my analysis of  <I>More Than Human</I>,
							I indicate the overt brand of humanism which is a theme of the
							book. The motivating, covert brand which Finer, and even Amis
							among others, refers to<I>, </I>is a factor in stories like
							&quot;Disappearing Act&quot;--which, as we shall see, condemns
							anti-humanism quite vigorously. Now, although science fiction
							author Miriam Allen De Ford is a contributing editor of  <I>The
							Humanist</I>, most of what I am calling the humanism of
							science fiction is not of the almost religious type of the
							American Humanist Association. The &quot;faith&quot; which
							impels the large class of optimistic stories comes closer to a
							rational Enlightenment, or perhaps even Renaissance,
							world-view. Although Amis refers slightingly to &quot;the
							pieties,&quot; I'm sure the Church, at least, would be
							relieved to find that &quot;the scientists&quot; aren't as
							cold and hard-hearted as they are sometimes thought to be.
							</P>
							<P>On
							the basis, then, of many critics' observations, there is some
							sort of humanism afoot in science fiction. But, it does not
							encourage deleterious moral consequences for the most part,
							and those stories which contain features currently unaccepted
							(e.g., Heinlein's court where children divorce their parents)
							must stand or fall on the rationale which the author offers
							for them. The apparent main-streamer's value judgment that
							unreasoned hopelessness is superior to reasoned hopefulness
							seems to me frankly to be the view of a closed mind which is
							quite alien to mine, exposed as it was to science fiction
							since age ten.
							</P>
							<P>Another
							point in regard to the content of science fiction is that of
							&quot;sophistication.&quot; Though Priestly and Lovell are
							still my <I>betes noires</I>, Amis's comment that science
							fiction is less sophisticated than other types (i.e.,
							main-stream) and in it we can &quot;doff that mental and moral
							best behavior with which we feel we have to treat George Eliot
							and James and Faulkner, and frolic like badly brought-up
							children among the mobile jellyfishes and unstable atomic
							piles&quot; (p. 133), leads me to believe that for a very
							bright young man he has a slight, unfortunate, tendency to be
							insufferably cute. Granted there can be a case made lamenting
							the passing of the oldstyle &quot;thud and blunder&quot; space
							opera. John Christopher, another English writer and this time
							one who has done science fiction, waxed sentimental (according
							to his own description) about the subject in the October,
							1956,  <I>Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction</I>. A recent
							issue of  <I>Saturday Review</I> also mentioned that the old
							days were more fun. But few readers today would think they
							could run barefoot through any of the current science fiction
							periodicals other than the remaining pulps, which we are
							blissfully ignoring here; for the pulps do not especially
							outnumber those periodicals in which, as Claire Holcomb said
							of  <I>Astounding</I> in particular, &quot;the quality of its
							stories, articles, editorials, and book reviews has
							consistently been far higher than that of its paper&quot;--and
							we, remember, are attempting to present reasonable grounds for
							agreeing or disagreeing with the &quot;more than pulp&quot;
							proposition. Mr. Amis's behavior can perhaps be best explained
							in terms of &quot;Give an author an image, and he'll take a
							metaphor.&quot; (As to examples of &quot;sophisticated&quot;
							stories, I would call attention especially to &quot;Disappearing
							Act&quot; and &quot;Poor Little Warrior,&quot; below.)
							</P>
							<P>The
							final point I shall discuss on the subject of critics'
							objections to the content of science fiction appears in rather
							curiously polarized form: Scientist J.R. Pierce, writing in
							 <I>Science</I>, claims that he finds the stories well written
							(a novel point) but decries the lack of scientific ideas which
							he wants for the confessed &quot;escape&quot; he is
							seeking.[30] Critic Joseph Kostolefsky, writing in  <I>Antioch
							Review</I>, thinks little of the writing (though he cites a
							few &quot;good&quot; writers), but decries the need for a
							special background to read the stuff which is &quot;as
							esoteric and incomprehensible to the layman as modern poetry
							ever was&quot;--and although the poetry requires &quot;patience,&quot;
							the science fiction requires &quot;infinite patience...[and a]
							short course in quantum mechanics.&quot;[3l] Assuming that
							both are honorable men and are reporting what they really
							found in their reading, the inescapable conclusion is that by
							some quirk of statistics neither read what the other was
							reading. Pierce's complaint is of course the result of a
							vested interest, and the appeal of straight science has a
							rather limited audience--although one friend of science
							fiction suggested to UNESCO that the teaching of science could
							be accomplished by means of encouraging backward peoples to
							read science fiction. Kostolefsky's complaint is more
							difficult to explain, but it is not valid statistically: of
							her 103 stories, Treguboff's analysts found only eleven to be
							gadget stories (which <I>might</I> have been
							&quot;over-scientific&quot;), and the technical sophistication
							required by the rest is quite minimal.
							</P>
							<P>To
							conclude this section on &quot;philosophical&quot; arguments,
							I should like to point out with pleasure one fact: Unless I
							missed them in the English periodical articles due to rapid
							reading from sheer distaste, I encountered none of the cries
							of &quot;But that nonsense couldn't <I>happen</I>&quot; which
							I had rather anticipated finding. At least the line between
							fantasy (which logically couldn't happen) and science fiction
							(which is of greater or lesser logical plausibility depending
							on the individual piece) is fairly clear in the critics'
							minds. For that I do not have to recite the arguments in favor
							of &quot;imagination&quot; and the like, I am duly grateful.
