				<h3 align=center>Introduction:
				Of &quot;Pulps&quot; and Respectability </I>
				</h3>
				<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
				<P>Originally,
				I decided to write a thesis &quot;about science fiction&quot;
				because too much reading of the stuff in my youth had impelled me
				to enter M.I.T., in hopes of becoming a physicist. Finding
				literature much more to my liking, I thought that I could do a
				thesis which would, in a way, be &quot;interdisciplinary&quot; by
				applying literary criticism to science fiction works. When I
				suggested this project to my thesis advisor, I was warned that
				science fiction was of dubious &quot;intellectual
				respectability,&quot; and that to convince the powers-that-be of
				the worthwhileness of such an undertaking would not be easy.
				Accordingly, I turned to the task of bibliography, expecting to
				find a very few articles by critics who thought it a great lark
				to say nasty things about science fiction; I assumed that I could
				dispense with them in a very few pages and then turn to my
				intended task of criticizing several pieces of science fiction,
				most of which I had already picked out.</P>
				<P>Much
				to my chagrin and dismay, I discovered that literally dozens of
				critics had felt the necessity of airing their views about
				science fiction. Although most of the criticisms were as silly as
				I had anticipated, there were so many of them that I felt
				compelled on grounds of intellectual honesty to criticize the
				criticisms in some detail and give the scoffers their day in
				court before I could turn in good conscience to any original
				criticism. Finally, the thesis shaped itself into its present
				form: an endeavor to dispel the illusion that science fiction is
				still the &quot;pulp&quot; medium which it admittedly was before
				the last War, with the original criticism included subordinately,
				only included to prove certain points about the larger question
				of whether or not science fiction has &quot;literary value&quot;--in
				the broad sense of being valuable literature. That science
				fiction has outgrown the days of the pulps, whose contents were
				characterized quite clearly by the buxom girls in cellophane
				spacesuits being menaced by Bug-Eyed Monsters (bems, to the
				initiate) which appeared on their covers, I shall attempt to
				show. Some pulps still exist, and some &quot;pulp&quot; stories
				appear even in the better science fiction publications, but
				stories worthy of serious consideration also appear, and in great
				enough number that serious literary critics would be well off to
				stop thinking of science fiction as a field barely one step from
				the comic books, and worthy of no more attention. 
				</P>
				<P>The
				critical objections break down into two areas: there are
				objections to what is being said in science fiction--what is
				called &quot;content&quot; in some critical circles--, and there
				are objections to how things are said--&quot;form&quot; in those
				same critical circles. In Chapter I, I deal with the general
				objections to content by means of cross-criticism and the
				injection of my own opinions where necessary. The problem of
				content is only part of the problem of literary value, however,
				and nowadays it seems to concern critics a good deal less than
				the problem of form. In the latter case, there are certain
				general claims and counter-claims which are deserving of note,
				and these I mention in the second half of my first chapter. The
				only fair test of the formal aspects of science fiction stories
				is in the analysis of individual stories themselves, however, for
				the generalizations of the critics and my general rebuttals have
				a very tenuous grounding in demonstrable reality. It was this,
				perhaps more difficult, analytical task which I had originally
				set myself, and hence I am able to turn with some pleasure to a
				few close readings in Chapter III, although they are nominally
				only intended to justify the conclusion that works of science
				fiction can be presented in an &quot;artistic&quot; style. 
				</P>
				<P>The
				basic endeavor of this thesis, then, is to determine whether or
				not science fiction can reasonably be considered as &quot;<I>more</I>
				than pulp&quot;-- and if not, to consign it back to the rubbish
				heap of mere entertainment. That science fiction <I>is</I>
				entertaining few dispute; indeed, one of the arguments I have
				encountered most frequently in speaking with avid science fiction
				readers (called &quot;fans&quot; by themselves, &quot;addicts&quot;
				by such institutions as  <I>Time</I> <I>Magazine</I>) is the argument
				that too much cerebrating about science fiction by people like me
				is ruining science fiction for them--by &quot;taking the fun out
				of it.&quot; All I can say before commencing to do so is that
				such &quot;cerebrating&quot; puts more fun into it for me, and in
				theory it also does so for any serious literary critic. Fun is
				where you find it.</P>
