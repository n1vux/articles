				<P>The
				first barrier and its related obstructions have considerable
				importance, and illustrate the linking of incompleteness (through
				their shutting-out power) with the development which results from
				their dissolution. In the second part of the book, we are dealing
				with Gerry's personal barriers primarily. In brief, his problem
				arose because he was unguarded (had no helping barrier) when
				Alicia was triggered by the phrase &quot;Baby is three&quot; into
				mentally reliving her experience with Lone three years before, at
				which time her own physical barrier (literally her hymen) had
				been broken; the resulting shock caused Gerry to develop his
				occlusion-barrier. (Indeed, there is a specific reference to
				&quot;that 'Baby is three' barrier,&quot; [p. 143] by Gerry to
				Stern.) Lone's breaking of Alicia's barrier was a reward to her
				for reading books and furnishing him with information he wanted.
				Gerry's consequent occlusion prevented him from using his
				telepathic powers until the barrier was broken down with Stern's
				aid. (Miss Kew herself represents a barrier: not only was she the
				cause of Gerry's occlusion, but she prevents the gestalt from
				bleshing--even tries to break it up by sending Baby away.)
				However, his incompleteness in the sense of lacking &quot;morality&quot;
				leads to the erection of a mental barrier in terms of his
				loneliness and difference from mankind. Finally, after Hip
				overcomes his Gerry-induced occlusion/barrier, it is possible to
				break down Gerry's barrier to &quot;morality&quot; and, in a
				different sense, the barrier between the Gerry-gestalt and the
				<I>&uuml;ber-gestalt</I> (which had been one of incompleteness).
				</P>
				<P>A
				distinct, but related complex of incidents are those relating to
				what we may call faulty assumptions, which may be looked upon as
				barriers between the maker of the assumption and reality. These,
				too, must be overcome before the final obviation of
				incompleteness can occur. Note Mr. Kew's mistaken notions of the
				good and evil of the world, for one. Further, the Prodds think
				Lone has suffered amnesia like Cousin Grace, that he is not
				(emphatically stated by Mrs. Prodd after looking at his eyes) an
				idiot, and that (for a time) he is their child. Gerry initially
				thinks all there is to the world is hate; Hip expects to find his
				goal in the army; Wilma thinks happiness comes in trousers. Or
				consider Lone himself. When he starts thinking at all, he first
				believes himself utterly alone ... and meets Janie, the twins,
				and eventually Baby. Then, there is his first notion of reality:
				</P>
				<BLOCKQUOTE>He
					had believed that Prodd was his only contact with anything
					outside himself and that the children were merely fellow
					occupants of a slag dump at the edge of mankind. The loss of
					Prodd--and he knew with unshakable certainty that he would never
					see the old man again--was the loss of life itself. At the very
					least, it was the loss of everything conscious, directed,
					cooperative; everything above and beyond what a vegetable could
					do by way of living. [p. 74]
					</P>
				</BLOCKQUOTE>
				<P>Two
				pages later he is exclaiming, &quot;And we'll grow, Baby. We just
				got born!&quot;, which is a correction to the one, and in itself
				another, mistake. For as Baby says, through Janie, they won't
				grow because the thing they are is an idiot. Later, Stern
				commences therapy (after thinking Gerry was a kid who had
				wandered in off the street) by refuting various &quot;thumbnail
				sketches&quot; of psychiatry. He ends with the mistaken notion
				that all Gerry needs is morality--mistaken because at the very
				end of the book the <I>&uuml;ber-gestalt</I> explains that the
				thing which caused completion was something more than ethics,
				which in turn are something more than morality. Even Gerry's
				assumption that he has no morality is false, for Lone had rebuked
				him for taking a bright yellow pen, and he had himself refrained
				from killing Stern--thinking (or rationalizing) that it was more
				&quot;amusing&quot; to let him live. Finally, Hip--for all his
				own mistaken assumptions about &quot;Thompson&quot; (the &quot;Air
				Force psychiatrist&quot; who was really Gerry), Janie's
				intentions, and his father's worth--manages to correct Janie's
				(and the Gerry-gestalt's) mistaken assumption that they're not
				human, and that humanity's rules don't apply to them.
				</P>

				<P>Linked
				in turn to the faulty assumptions are those factors of the work
				which involve confusion or muddling of identity. They may be
				further considered as barriers between the individual and the
				world. Already noted in a different context is the fact that the
				Idiot is nameless for some time. Who &quot;Jack&quot; (the son
				they had lost) is to the Prodds is not revealed immediately, nor
				are the roles of Gerry and Hip. Janie has no last name when she
				is introduced. Later she is to call herself Janie Gerard--Gerard,
				Gerry's name because she is part of the Gerry-gestalt; this
				identify is slammed into the reader's attention when the sheriff
				who is keeping Hip mistakes the name twice. And it is just such a
				muddling, merging, and confusing of identities which is the
				mechanism of the formation of the gestalt organism, which in some
				undefinable but natural way is &quot;I&quot;. Getting back to
				Gerry as &quot;individual,&quot; he starts his interview with
				Stern by refusing to reveal his identity (for which, in another
				sense, he is actually looking). Stern reminds him of Lone. When
				he returns to consciousness after breaking through the occlusion
				it is on &quot;two distinct levels&quot; (as 11 years old and in
				shock from the ego transference, and as 15 and on Stern's couch),
				and in the unconscious state he had <I>been</I> Alicia Kew. He
				killed her because of another identity confusion; which is also
				linked here to the occlusion/barrier:
				</P>
				<BLOCKQUOTE>You
					talk about occlusions! I couldn't get past the 'Baby is three'
					thing because in it lay the clues to what I really am. I
					couldn't find that out because I was afraid to remember that I
					was two things--Miss Kew's little boy and something a hell of a
					lot bigger. I couldn't be both, and I wouldn't release either
					one. [p. 143]
					</P>
				</BLOCKQUOTE>
				<P>Notice
				also the typical incomplete, stepwise revelation of facts. In the
				third part, the entire story revolves around the clarification of
				identity: Hip doesn't know who he is, who Janie is, who
				&quot;Thompson&quot; is; and meanwhile Gerry has regressed to a
				childish state, having lost his sense of identity. Also, on an
				overall basis there is a certain confusion for the reader
				resulting from the shifts in the &quot;identity&quot; of the
				narrator: Part One is in the third person with Lone as major
				character in terms of quantity of description at least; Part Two
				is in the first person, with Gerry as narrator; Part Three is
				back to the third person, and Hip is the &quot;major&quot;
				character. The finishing touch is the confusion as to whether the
				Gerry-gestalt is an individual unit or a segment of the larger
				&quot;unit,&quot; and of course the resolution of the
				misconceptions as to what humanity (or mankind) is.
				</P>
				<P>Thus
				far we have seen three interrelated groups of incidents and
				images all of which are also related to the theme of
				incompleteness. Another group can be discovered by noting a
				peculiar common pattern to the family relationships and the
				natures of the parents in the book. The families are incomplete,
				for the most part, and the parents are bad. Mrs. Kew had died,
				Mr. Kew is insane; the Prodds don't have Jack, but they drive
				Lone out preparing for him--thus betraying their position as
				surrogate parents to Lone; Wilma has no husband, she is
				adulterous and stupid and soon drives Janie out; Hip's mother is
				never mentioned, his father disowns him after trying to crush his
				technical talents in favor of medicine; Gerry has no parents, his
				surrogate family of the orphanage drives him out with its cruelty
				and viciousness. The reactions are Alicia's rather pathological
				desire for a family (she sent Baby away because she couldn't
				pretend he was her child), Gerry's submission to Lone and need to
				consult Stern (both men being surrogate parents, and even being
				confused for one another by Gerry), and Hip's great desire to
				impress his Colonel and his repeated thinking of himself as &quot;ROTC
				<I>boy</I>&quot; (the Colonel obviously having been taken as
				&quot;father&quot; to replace the hated doctor). Familial
				incompleteness is a causal agent, then; it stimulates change, and
				change leads to progress. At the end of it all is the realization
				that mankind is the parent of the gestalt, and the resulting
				&quot;good&quot; progress for the race as a whole which is
				fostered by a &quot;complete&quot; family.
				</P>
				<P>Incompleteness
				is usually a passive thing: an idiot remains an idiot in the real
				world, and a body lacking a part cannot grow it or absorb it from
				its environment. In  <I>More Than Human</I>, though, there are
				active drives and &quot;natural&quot; urges which combat
				incompletenesses and promote development. The greatest number of
				them act on Lone, for he is an idiot and needs the most prodding.
				He goes to Evelyn in response to a call he feels:
				</P>
				<BLOCKQUOTE>Without
					analysis, he was aware of the bursting within him of an encysted
					need ... And bursting so, it flung a thread across his internal
					gulf, linking his alive and independent core to the half-dead
					animal around it. It was a sending straight to what was human in
					him, received by an instrument which, up to now, had accepted
					only the incomprehensible radiations of the new-born, and so had
					been ignored. [pp. 9-10]
					</P>
				</BLOCKQUOTE>
				<P>To
				become more than human, one must first become human. Lone's drive
				brings him up against the barrier around the Kew place, and
				forces him to find a way through it. He feels a similar call from
				Janie and the twins, but is disappointed when he discovers it is
				only the sending of some hungry children. Their hunger, another
				natural drive, brings them to him, though. And he feeds them and
				takes them in because he recalls Mrs. Prodd's hospitality (&quot;Now
				you set right down and have some breakfast&quot;) and wishes to
				mimic it. By so doing, he becomes not only more &quot;human,&quot;
				but more nearly complete, for he accepts the kids. It is,
				finally, his urge to know what he is and what he belongs to
				(which urge is shared by every kind of people, according to Baby)
				that leads him to the discovery of &quot;his&quot; gestalt
				nature.
				</P>
				<P>Hip
				was driven from his father because of his curiosity; Gerry was
				driven from the orphanage by the hate which he had come to think
				of as natural. Gerry's reason for killing Alicia Kew is to ensure
				the survival of the gestalt. When Gerry remembers Lone through
				Alicia's thoughts, Lone mentions another natural drive, &quot;All
				I know is I got to do what I'm doing like a bird's got to nest
				when it's time.&quot; (p. 134) That is Lone's description of why
				he stays in the woods, waiting to complete himself. Later, when
				Miss Kew asks him, &quot;What made you start doing this?&quot;
				after Lone tells her about the gestalt, he answers &quot;What
				made you start growing hair in your armpits? ... You don't figure
				a thing like that. It just happens.&quot; (p. 138)
				</P>
				<P>Stern
				asks Gerry, after he had explained the gestalt organism, &quot;What
				now?&quot; Gerry replies, &quot;We'll just do what comes
				naturally.&quot; (p. 144) When Gerry implants a drive in Hip (the
				sickness compulsion, and attendant occlusion of memory), he is
				himself nearly destroyed as a result. Unnatural drives are not
				good. On the other hand, Hip's compulsion to prove himself right
				about the anti-gravity device, though motivated by pride perhaps,
				is a natural drive, which finally leads to the completion of the
				Gerry-gestalt. Natural drives are both, good and functional.
				</P>
				<P>The
				drives lead to development, or progress. Structurally, they may
				be looked on as the link between the theme of incompleteness and
				a theme of development, of progress toward the final completion.
				Also, in the context built up in the book, natural drives combat
				incompletenesses on the level of content or incidents. Barriers
				must be overcome, by penetration or circumvention. Identity must
				be found. Faulty assumptions must be corrected; the incomplete
				ones must be expanded, just as Hip's &quot;world&quot; expands
				(&quot;It's as if my whole world, everywhere I lived, was once in
				a little place inside my head, so deep I could't see out. And
				then you made it as big as a room and then as big as a town ...&quot;
				p. 172, to Janie). The formal parallel is the final completion of
				&quot;factual&quot; revelations which takes place in Part Three.
				</P>
				<P>There
				are many incidents which depict development. For instance, the
				development of Lone--his &quot;humanization.&quot; He develops
				volition at the wall around the Kew place. He develops the power
				of communication with Prodd, both telepathically and verbally.
				After leaving the Prodds, he becomes aware of time for the first
				time. Because the Prodds wanted him to leave, he develops the
				human trait of self-pity; he berates himself for his lonliness.
				He parallels the development of man by becoming a tool-using
				animal when he borrows an ax from Prodd to build himself a
				shelter. He begins the comtemplative thought which caused Gerry
				to remember him later as &quot;like always, walking along,
				thinking, thinking.&quot; In short, as he realizes, &quot;The
				Prodds were one thing, and when they took him in they became
				something else; he knew it now. And then when he was by himself
				he was one thing; but taking in those kids he was something
				else.&quot; (p. 67) In Lone as a person we see the process of
				development, the process of becoming, the process of life.
				</P>
				<P>However,
				the final development of Lone as an individual is not the final
				development of his gestalt organism. When he says to Baby &quot;We'll
				grow!&quot; Baby replies, through Janie, &quot;He says not on
				your life. He says not with a head like that. We can do
				practically anything but we most likely won't. He says we're a
				thing, all right, but the thing is an idiot.&quot; (p. 76) When
				Lone dies, a new head takes over; and the acquisition of Gerry as
				head is the second step in the development of the gestalt.
				Gerry's &quot;personal&quot; development requires the catalyst of
				Hip, though, for the third stage of the gestalt's development to
				proceed to completion. Gerry must kill Miss Kew in the meantime
				to remove the threat to his potential development; he has also
				become aware of himself as a biological development, employing
				metaphors involving Neanderthal and Peking man in the course of
				his personal &quot;development&quot; (actually a cure, a return
				to normal from abnormal) with Stern.
