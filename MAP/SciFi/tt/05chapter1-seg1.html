							<h3 align=center>Chapter
							I:  Of Critics and Crabs, A Survey of Science Fiction
							Criticism
							</h3>
							<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
							<P>Now
							that  <I>Time</I> has promoted science fiction addicts from the
							class of &quot;such pariahs as matchbook collectors,
							astrologers, dog breeders... &quot; to &quot;the social level
							of horse players ($50 and $100 windows), opera lovers,
							physicists, bridge careerists and sportscar nuts,&quot;[1]
							perhaps one can ask no more. Also, if Mr. Kingsley &quot;( <I>Lucky
							Jim</I>)&quot; Amis had, in his  <I>New Maps of Hell</I> which
							 <I>Time</I> was reviewing when it expressed the above
							&quot;approval,&quot; suitably demonstrated the worth of
							science fiction,[2] we might not need to consider science
							fiction criticism in general but could turn directly to the
							works. However, neither of them has given us &quot;the
							answer.&quot; Amis is mainly dealing in apologism and
							rationalization, pitched in terms of the &quot;true
							confessions of an addict.&quot; His major contribution is a
							detailed analogy between science fiction and modern jazz,
							which is helpful, but unfortunately leaves the impression
							(which he later expresses overtly) that science fiction is
							something different from the rest of literature.  <I>Time</I>,
							on the other hand, is being clever.
							</P>
							<P>Science
							fiction, of course, does not exist. This is an assumption, and
							as such I shall not attempt to elaborate upon it to too great
							an extent. My point is purely that we must realize before
							proceeding that in the field of literature as a whole there
							are many works which share the common science fiction
							characteristics of being either future-projected or taking
							place in a non-&quot;historical&quot; past or present, and
							which are not fantasy because they entail no contravention of
							the known laws of the universe. The only apparent reason for a
							critic to call a work of this sort &quot;science fiction&quot;
							is to trade upon the pejorative value of the term (or if he is
							a &quot;fan,&quot; to trade upon the approbative value). Mr.
							Kenneth Methold, who has independently stated my feelings,
							makes the next logical step, after pointing out the error of
							making science fiction into a &quot;genre&quot; of the same
							sort as the &quot;Western&quot;:[3]
							</P>
							<BLOCKQUOTE>Eighty
								percent of science fiction may be rubbish [what we are
								calling here &quot;pulp&quot;], but this is little
								justification for ignoring the worthwhile twenty per cent...
								It is, in fact, time that science fiction was released from
								the &quot;novelty corner&quot; and included in that class of
								writing known simply as &quot;fiction&quot; where it would
								receive the attention and respect that any serious and
								competent novel deserves.
								</P>
							</BLOCKQUOTE>
							<P>And
							this is the other assumption I wish to make. However, its
							justification will be more involved than the simple semantic
							argument against the employment of &quot;science fiction&quot;
							as a blanket pejorative (and the consideration of works like
							 <I>Brave New World</I> as &quot;something else&quot;--i.e., as
							&quot;too good to be science fiction&quot;). The justification
							leads us perforce to the problem of what reasons the critics
							offer for condemning or praising science fiction in general.
							We must consider such reasons before we can in good conscience
							consider Methold's and my assumption that science fiction is
							deserving of serious criticism to be acceptable.
							</P>
							<P>The
							first aspect of the problem of science fiction criticism is
							that of definition and classification, which most try--but
							none really manage. Let us concede that, as in all areas of
							literature, the task of definition is more trouble than it is
							worth--the boundaries are simply too fuzzy. Mr. Damon Knight,
							a science fiction author <I>cum</I> critic whose book of
							science fiction criticism (done as straight literary
							criticism--the only such work I have come across),  <I>In
							Search of Wonder</I>,[4] I shall refer to again, resolves
							things admirably by saying of science fiction that &quot;like
							the 'Saturday Evening Post', it means what we point to when we
							say it.&quot;
							</P>
							<P>Classificatory
							schemes run rampant through the body of science fiction
							criticism, probably because once you say &quot;science
							fiction&quot; is like &quot;Westerns&quot; or &quot;detective
							stories,&quot; or better still &quot;it's all gadgetism and
							escapism,&quot; you double your pejorative punch. The range is
							amusing, from fourteen year old Tom Pulvertaft' s &quot;Five
							Types of Science Fiction&quot;[5] (which  <I>Spectator</I>
							apparently printed because they don't care too much for
							science fiction and because young Tom wanted money for a
							typewriter) to Dr. Zoe Treguboff's intelligently-conceived
							dozen types in her doctoral dissertation, which was a content
							analysis of science fiction.[6] Though science fiction author
							Jack Williamson called it &quot;Science Fiction in a Robot's
							Eye&quot; in an  <I>Astounding Science Fiction</I> article,
							&quot;content analysis&quot; can be quite useful for our
							purposes. It entails the questioning of a panel of readers to
							determine their reactions as to what was &quot;in&quot; a
							group of randomly selected stories, hence furnishing a rather
							solid statistical basis for argument. Dr. Treguboff used 103
							samples chosen from the 1951-1953 issues of  <I>Astounding</I>,
							 <I>Galaxy</I>, and  <I>If: Worlds of Science Fiction</I> at
							random. I shall refer to her statistical findings as the need
							arises.
							</P>
							<P>For
							the sake of novelty, as well as because it is not a useful
							enterprise here, I shall refrain from offering my impressions
							as to the categories into which science fiction stories break
							down. I should like to point out, however, a possible
							misassumption of, among others, Mr. Amis's. One should not be
							deluded by the fact that science fiction has a virtual corner
							on today's satire market into thinking that all science
							fiction is satire or satirical even in a broad sense of the
							term. Aside from brave new worlds, the legitimate province of
							science fiction also includes such works as  <I>More Than Human</I>
							and  <I>The Puppet Masters</I> (both discussed in Chapter III)
							which respectively deal, ultimately, with the progress in the
							future, and the special talent in the &quot;present&quot;, of
							humanity. As a simple polarity to satire, and leaving out some
							other types, science fiction <I>also</I> actively advocates
							points of view--as opposed to criticizing ones which are felt
							to be bad. Amis's discussion is so largely in terms of the
							values of social criticism that the &quot;other&quot; breeds
							of science fiction tend to be obscured.</P>
							<P>Speaking
							of breeds of science fiction, I should like to mention that I
							am dealing here strictly with modern science fiction, and for
							that matter modern criticism, both post-1946. I must admit
							that I agreed wholeheartedly with Professor Norbert Wiener,
							whose opinions are doubly to be esteemed--both as one of the
							country's most renowned scientists, and as an occasional
							author of science fiction (as &quot;W. Norbert&quot;)--, when
							he urged upon me the importance of the older members of the
							canon. Much can be gained if only in the way of understanding
							from looking at writers from Verne and Wells through all the
							utopians, and Swift and Voltaire, all the way back to Lucian
							of Samosota--or even to Plato. However, it is today's science
							fiction which is subjected to the critical denigration which,
							as Patrick Moore says, Verne, for example, was not: Verne's
							work was treated on its own merits by his critics, but the
							intervening pulps gave science fiction a black eye which
							critics today seem loath to let heal.[7] The black eye must be
							healed before the mascara of such issues as Wiener's
							discussion of &quot;The Need for Interdisciplinary Thinking in
							Science and Literature&quot; can be appreciated. I repeat,
							then, that what we are about is a just investigation to
							determine whether science fiction is <I>more</I> than the
							&quot;pulp&quot; of what I take to be the middle period. To
							quote Mr. Amis:[8]
							</P>
							<BLOCKQUOTE>It
								is hard to believe that anything likely to interest a grown
								man could lie under a cover-picture of a multi-armed alien
								Santa Claus, an ASF cover of a year or two ago, which I
								thought fairly amusing, or within a journal called  <I>Fantastic
								Universe</I> or  <I>Astounding Science Fiction</I>, but I hope
								to establish that these natural suspicions are often
								unjustified.</P>
							</BLOCKQUOTE>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
							<H4 align=center>A.
							&quot;Silly&quot; Arguments</H4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
							<P>The
							most fatuous and annoying attack on science fiction, though
							compensatingly the easiest to rebut, is what I call the &quot;kid
							stuff&quot; approach. There are two forms, one of which
							consists of the journals' persistence in reviewing science
							fiction as juvenilia. The worst offender is  <I>Library
							Journal</I>, which relegates science fiction to its &quot;Junior
							Libraries&quot; section. One L. Bulman[9] reports that he
							rejected Heinlein's  <I>Star Beast</I> in his library because
							of an episode in a &quot;divorce court&quot; wherein children
							divorce their parents, and decries &quot;the vast amount of
							bad science fiction ground out even by good authors who seem
							to be groping fruitlessly for new ideas.&quot; In case no one
							has told him, such &quot;new ideas&quot; are the life-blood of
							literature in general, and of science fiction in particular.
							(The title of the article, by the way: &quot;Using Science
							Fiction as Bait&quot;--to get the kiddies into the library, so
							that they will get around to the better stuff.) Following
							Bulman, science fiction anthologist Groff Conklin indulged in
							a bit of apologism called &quot;What is Good Science Fiction?&quot;
							which spoke, per contra, of the &quot;moral&quot; value
							kiddies can derive from the good stuff.[1O] Still in the
							Junior section, though even more out of place because grown-up
							himself, H.A. Webb stresses the prevalence of social
							philosophy and the tracing out of the impacts of science in
							science fiction.[ll]As bad as Bulman's is an article in  <I>The
							Horn Book</I> (&quot;of Books and Reading for Children and
							Young People&quot;) , in which we find a New York librarian
							declaiming, &quot;We have steered clear of questionable
							ethics, morals, and philosophies and have selected stories
							which meet our standards for good fiction.&quot;[12] I trust
							she keeps  <I>Lolita</I> out of her juvenile book shelves also,
							although it would seem that it has exactly the same claims for
							inclusion as most of the science fiction books which suffer
							the fate--and that is simply the age of one or more of the
							major characters.
							</P>
							<P>The
							apparent reason for assumedly serious, intelligent individuals
							missing the point of such devices as divorce courts for
							children (it's an &quot;off-beat&quot; idea, hence satire;
							it's not a suggestion, hence subversive as juvenile fiction)
							is that the &quot;product-image&quot; or popular stereotype of
							science fiction is too much in terms of &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;
							or &quot;Superman&quot; comic strips--hence they expect
							science fiction novels to be juvenile, and if they contain
							juveniles as characters they <I>must</I> be intended for
							children. To the same depth of analysis,  <I>Lolita</I> has
							dozens of analogues in  <I>Saturday Evening Post</I> stories
							about step-fathers who win the love of their precious but
							bewildered little adopted daughters. John W. Campbell, editor
							of  <I>Astounding</I> since the 30's , has pointed out that
							Buck Rogers is precisely as representative of science fiction
							as Dick Tracy is of detective stories; both fields are
							amenable to sophisticated, serious works, but the successes of
							both have been capitalized upon by the real &quot;pulps&quot;--the
							comics .[13]
							</P>
							<P>The
							next most silly attacks are found in the &quot;clever&quot;
							English periodicals. Of the three I shall mention (four, if
							you count Master Pulvertaft), the most egregious is one A.C.B.
							Lovell who took it upon himself to issue a &quot;Counterblast
							to Science Fiction.&quot;[14] His most notable comment is in
							regard to  <I>Astounding</I>, of which he declares, &quot;The
							very title ... is repellent.&quot; Mr. J.B. Priestley, the
							professed &quot;historian of Western Literature&quot; displays
							a lamentable literary blind-spot in a pair of  <I>New Statesman</I>
							articles. His extensive readings, he says, have led him to see
							three types of science fiction, Western, Gadget, and
							Human:[15] The value judgments are built in, only the &quot;Human&quot;
							story can ever be any good for him. He claims that &quot;No
							civilized men are wanted in the age of space. No art, no
							philosophy, not [sic] wit and humor, no passion and
							tenderness.&quot; Perhaps the examples mentioned in Mr. Amis's
							book will serve to disabuse him of this notion, which seems to
							come from reading too many pulps picked up in railroad
							stations. His criticism of &quot;escapism,&quot; in &quot;Who
							Goes Where,&quot; is effectively scuttled by his own admission
							that one of his favorite science fiction novels is  <I>Occam's
							Razor</I>, which I would point out deals quite literally with
							escapism--into another &quot;time-track.&quot;[16] Finally,
							one A. Staggers staggers through a good deal of double-talk
							allegedly parodying the pseudoscientific jargon he has
							encountered in science fiction.[17] The overall point is that
							these men are writing &quot;humor&quot;--or perhaps what they
							think is satire. We must recognize this fact, and not expect a
							reasoned critique. I think what they are doing can be
							legitimately branded as reactionary, and after having duly
							mentioned its existence I shall pass on to more reasonable
							arguments. I mention such &quot;criticism&quot; simply to
							impress upon the reader just how much hostility has been
							mobilized against science fiction only because it has a &quot;bad
							name,&quot; and not even on the pretence of keeping literature
							&quot;pure.&quot;
							</P>
							<P>Bordering
							between the former ridiculous and latter sublime, however, are
							three issues which are both &quot;silly&quot; and, in a sense,
							&quot;philosophical&quot;: In the first place, there is the
							whole issue of the science fiction-Western parallel. The most
							common claim is that science fiction is composed of &quot;space
							operas&quot; in which spaceships have been substituted for
							horses and rayguns for sixguns. Now, granted there are
							numerous works (mostly from the '30s) which are guilty of this
							charge. However, 1.) they were strictly for entertainment--as
							Westerns were before the new &quot;psychological&quot;
							binge--, and 2.) they aren't being written anymore. The same
							overall answer which holds in regard to Westerns also applies
							to the &quot;it's all gadgetry&quot; and &quot;escapism&quot;
							charges--the objectors simply haven't read enough science
							fiction. This is especially true of Clifton Fadiman, who
							rather breathlessly expostulated in  <I>Holiday</I>, &quot;Begotten
							by Imagination on the body of Technology there springs forth
							the wild child, Science Fiction, grasping in his hand--the
							gadget...&quot;[18] He also speaks of it as an &quot;outlet
							for our daydreams.&quot; The works I treat in Chapter III, by
							no means uniquely isolated examples, should dispel the above
							&quot;that's all there is&quot; type charges.
							</P>
							<P>The
							question of &quot;gadgets&quot; deserves further treatment.
							Clearly, the link between science and technology means that
							&quot;science&quot; fiction will frequently have recourse to
							the introduction of technological changes into stories.
							However, it is folly to assume that &quot;they are all 'about'
							gadgets.&quot; There are stories, granted, which exist solely
							to have fun with the extrapolation of a new &quot;gadget.&quot;
							A good example is the &quot;Lewis Padgett&quot; (he's a known
							pseudonym, and it just occurred to me that maybe he is a pun
							on &quot;<I>g</I>adgett&quot;) series about Gallagher the
							genius-only-when-inebriated and his narcissistic robot, Joe.
							Or go back to Hugo Gernsback, who is considered to be the
							father of modern science fiction; in his epoch-making (not
							good, mind you, just epoch-making), early twentieth century
							 <I>Ralph 124C4l</I>, among other things, like Huxleyian
							hypnopaedia, he also coined the word &quot;television.&quot;
							Let's not hold him responsible for the result, let's just
							realize that science fiction gadgets can be interesting and
							they can also play integral parts in the development of a
							story, especially a satire. &quot;Classic&quot; examples are
							the two-way television in  <I>1984</I> and the Hatchery (to
							name just one) in  <I>Brave New Wor1d</I>; but even a more
							recent, less renowned, book (Shepard Mead's  <I>The Big Ball of
							Wax</I>) employs a gadget dubbed XT (which transcribes and
							transmits experiences--including sex, naturally) as the means
							by which the admen achieve the ultimate in captive audiences.
							Our moral is that gadgets are necessary for the construction
							of &quot;serious&quot; satire. As well, I might add, they are
							functional in serious investigations of human nature; e.g.,
							Isaac Asimov's robotics stories, one of the most interesting
							of which deals with a professor's attempt to discredit a robot
							which reads proof--and makes corrections which the professor
							(humanistically though) resents (&quot;Galley Slave&quot; in
							the December, 1957  <I>Galaxy</I>).</P>
