<H3 align=center>Chapter IV: Of Tygers and Men, A Conclusion or Two</H3>
<H3>&nbsp;</H3>
We have reached the point at which we have a good deal of
evidence for agreeing with a statement of Dr. Treguboff's, which she
put forth quite early in her thesis:

<BLOCKQUOTE>Science
fiction is a subject of many popular misconceptions. It is believed,
for example, that it is a form of pulp fiction, with no literary
merit, whose content is about gadgets, space adventures, and
monsters, and whose readers and authors are people of small education
and smaller literary discriminations. Little, if any, factual basis
exists for these beliefs. (pp.24-5)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course, not all of her assertions are amenable to statistical
treatment--this is one of the reasons why my thesis was necessary.
However, I am not attempting to draw the cloak of
statistical/scientific respectability about science fiction on the
basis of the quotation; the point is that Dr. Treguboff read a good
deal of science fiction, and did so under the enforced objectivity of
her panel, and after so reading was convinced that the above remarks
were justifiably to be made in her doctoral dissertation. I stress
the source merely because one is far more likely to be certain of
one's ground before taking stands in a thesis than in a periodical
article. Science fiction, then, can convince others, on the basis of
intuitive and/or statistical evidence, that it is more than pulp.
<p>
The logic behind the evidence I have discussed was as follows:
after reading and sorting out numerous critical opinions, I saw that
critics object to either the content of science fiction or to its
form. The content, we saw, can be both morally and cognitively
valuable--and has been so not merely in a few exceptional cases but
in enough cases that it may be considered to be a regular
occurence--and a few of these cases were illustrated in the text. The
form, too, can satisfy conventional critical criteria; this was
illustrated in a lengthy reading of a Sturgeon novel, and shorter
readings of Bester and Aldiss short stories. Hence, science fiction
<I>is</I> more than pulp, on the basis of evidence which is literary
criticism and not mere unsupported intuition.
</p>
<p>The first conclusion I should like to offer is this: it is
obvious to even the most casual reader that not all the science
fiction which is turned out even in the modern period is good
literature; however, because there can be quite excellent stories in
among the whole range of science fiction, it is clear that the critic
and the general reader will be missing much if they ignore the field
as a second-class citizen of literature--as &quot;pulp&quot;, that
is. Therefore, it is incumbent upon &quot;serious&quot; critics and
readers to deal seriously with science fiction, at the risk of
otherwise missing valuable and enjoyable literary experiences, for it
too can furnish all the characteristics which they praise in other
fields of literature.
</p>
<p>Actually, the above paragraph is the real conclusion of this
thesis, at least on the grounds of the material I have already
presented. However, I should like to offer an observation not based
on the evidence above, but stemming from it, which might help to
explain why the blind-spot in the &quot;popular&quot; view of science
fiction has persisted. My second &quot;conclusion&quot; is that there
exists a science fiction sensibility, a special temperament which is
either induced or appealed to by science fiction. The sensibility is
perhaps best characterized by an experience I had recently: I was
sitting in on an Introduction to Literature class which was
discussing Blake's &quot;The Tyger,&quot; and found that while most
of the people in the class were speaking of the Tyger as an evil
entity about which the poet could not decide whether it had been
created by God or by The Enemy, I was myself &quot;for&quot; the
Tyger and in sympathy with it. That is, it seemed to me perfectly
valid to look upon it as a self-generating entity, splendid in its
vigor and strength, which in a sense had created itself, and which
was capable of &quot;taking on&quot; the Universe. The instructor,
with whom I was taking a special readings in poetry course, later
confirmed the plausibility at least of my alternative view. Then I
realized that my view of the Tyger was virtually identical to
Heinlein's view of Man in <I>The Puppet Masters</I> (see Chapter III)
and hence to a quite prevalent science fiction viewpoint. The science
fiction sensibility, then, is one which actively entertains the
notion that Man is not inherently depraved, but is at least <I>capable</I>
of progress. &quot;Down-beat&quot; science fiction stories are
usually warnings against the opposing view; a work like <I>On The
Beach</I>, that is, is a warning type, but it would be more common
(though less effective psychologically) to find in what we might call
mainstream science fiction the hero going off with his lady love and
submerging his submarine beneath the polar icecap until the radiation
had died down--analogous to the action in Wylie's <I>When Worlds
Collide</I>--instead of docilely surrendering to the hostile
Universe. If I were the psychologist-statistician Dr. Treguboff is, I
would have tested my notion by means of questioning fans and antis
about their reactions to the Blake poem; however, I could not have
constructed a valid test myself, and so I shall let the issue rest on
the suggestion that there is a science fiction sensibility and that
it can be operationally defined in terms of reaction to &quot;The
Tyger&quot;--at least I shall let it rest until I write an <I>Astounding</I>
article about it.
</p>
<p>A final comment: John Campbell is changing the name of <I>Astounding</I>
to <I>Analog Science Fact and Fiction</I> for the express purpose of
not scaring off the pulp-conscious prospective buyer. Though the
howls from the sentimentalists are long and loud, I think it
commendable that Campbell should be willing to meet the uninitiated
more than half way, and hope that the pulp misappellation will soon
be dispelled.
</p>
<p>In conclusion, whether one is a Tyger-fancier or a critic who is
looking for valuable literary experiences, science fiction is good
stuff. I shall write at no greater length about it, because--and this
is perhaps the <I>real</I> test of literary value--I'd rather go read
it.</p>
