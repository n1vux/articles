<blockquote><i>Note: Between an early, importantish historical datum (boldfaced) and a couple
of late, interestingish opinions (also boldfaced), which I'd very much like you to see,
there's perhaps more detail about Form here than
will be of interest to some readers.  Well, OK, make that of interest to more than a very few readers.  So if you find things
getting dull after you've seen the first boldfaced point, do feel free to hit the End key; but
it would be nice if you scrolled back up a couple of screens' worth once you got to the bottom, to see
both a brief but pertinent paragraph about the Content and said possibly interesting opinions....</i></blockquote>

<p>What happened was that on August 8, 2000 Peter e-mentioned that he
and John were going to be sponsoring an &quot;sf site&quot;. I of
course immediately replied:</p>

<blockquote class="email">
<p>&gt;<BR>why, then, y'll probably want a copy of the 2nd [*] known
academic thesis on s.f. as literature on it.</p>

wants to send me one [suitable for an elderly mac; i.e., scsi, i
suppose] i cld prevail upon bill to make good on his threatxxxpromise

<p>[<i>emphasis added, 11/03</i>] &nbsp;&nbsp; in my usual personal
e-correspondence shiftless approach to typing, meant to save a little
wearntear on the wristsnfingers (and shoulders ... and, latterly,
neck, dammit). Don't worry about exactly who Peter, John, and Bill <a href="#who" name="who" class="footnote"></a><span>"Bill" is your Humble Editor here, and Literary Executor.</span>
are at this point, but do be aware that naturally I'd BCC'd Bill.</p>

<p>A week went by with no response from anybody. Then on the 15th I
was invited by Bill to FTP the half-a-meg of &quot;<code>caviar.zip</code>&quot;.
After a grin at the filename (because, as he of course well knew, a
large portion of the thing had to do with a novel by Theodore
Sturgeon) and an hour or two of figuring out how to unzip on the
&quot;Performa&quot; I'd explicitly gotten so as not to have to
confront Whinedopes 95 when I'd needed a new computoy ~4 years
previously and a friend had offered me use of the Employee Discount
plan at Apple (I viewed it as the ultimate Microsoft-aversion
therapy, myself), sure enough it turned out there were all these
&quot;<code>.doc</code>&quot; files in it. After sundry misadventures, I even got
them all to open, so that I could begin to proofread them.</p>
<p>The next I've-lost-count hours over the next who-knows-how-many
days were spent cleansing the scanned files. (For the benefit of any
who read this who haven't had to deal with the results of even
allegedly pretty good &quot;OCR&quot; software, if you can avoid
doing so, do.) In the course of that, I realized I ought to say a few
things about how I chose to render the e-ificiation of what had been
a manually typed document in its p-youth, in consultation with Bill,
who's a skilled amateur typographer, or whatever the Fancy is for
printer--though, in fairness to him, it must be noted that I decided
not to accept a number of his good suggestions for no better reason
than that they ran counter to my arbitrary tastes.</p>

<p>(No, it didn't take three years to finish proofreading--though the
<b>Padlipsky's Law</b> which holds <b>&quot;There's always one more typo&quot;</b>
dictates that I haven't finished yet, of course. It's just that the
&quot;SF site&quot; never happened, and for any number of reasons I
didn't get around to doing anything with the results until sometime
around October of 2003, when the event sketched in the
<b>Corrigendum to the Bibliography</b> prompted me to finally get around to
doing a month or more's worth of final polishing and then set about getting permission
from M.I.T. to do whatever I wanted with it, including but not
limited to putting a copy in/on my &quot;personal web page&quot; ...
a permission necessitated by the fact that, as far as I knew then or
even know now, back when I submitted it the copyright belonged to the
'Tute.)</p>

<p>Soooooo.... The typeface that seemed to come closest--or at least
acceptably close--to the original typing was &quot;<code>Times</code>&quot;, so I
chose it (except for this section, &quot;obviously&quot; ... unless
you've got your &quot;browser&quot; set to enforce your own font
choices, and your choice happens to be &quot;<code>Times</code>&quot;, anyway,
and/or unless it's of a vintage that doesn't deal correctly with the
generation of &quot;HTML&quot; I'm using and does things I can't
influence w/r/t fonts). But the idea wasn't to do a facsimile. After
all, I'd mainly had it retyped in '68 in order to do some clean-up so
as to make it submitable for publication, so fixing further typoes
and spelling errors still seemed to be fair game, to the extent I
could bring myself to look for them amidst all the de-underlining of
spaces and turning right-parentheses back into the commas they
started out as and the like.</p>


<p>I even caved-in and went along
				with Bill's &quot;spellchecker's&quot; view about not doubling
				final consonants when suffixing, just to be a good sport
				(although I did draw the line on &quot;advertising&quot; vs.
				&quot;advertizing&quot;, since I still find the former awf'leh
				Anglofahl and I never was <I>that</I> Anglophile even in my
				Anglophile youth, before all the field trips to Scotland in aid
				of my real area of research interest led me to become
				Caledonaphile instead).</p>
				<p>And changing from indented
				paragraphs to &quot;block&quot; ones made double sense: not only
				wasn't it necessary to save paper by avoiding the doublespaces
				anymore, but when I did the conversion it was seemingly also the
				case that &quot;HTML&quot; was shamefully inept at dealing with
				indents, so it's more convenient to change when the version
				you're working on is intended to be webulated (especially when
				the change can be effected for the whole file at once, with
				relatively little additional risk to the wristsnfingers).
				Actually, make that triple sense: I also prefer the &quot;look&quot;--which
				consideration also eventually convinced me to drop the
				typewriter-necessitated underlining in favor of italics, I should
				add ... thus perhaps suggesting that I'm not hopelessly Twentieth
				Century no matter what They say. (Well, OK, at least not
				<I>mid</I>-Twentieth Century....)</p>

				<p>There are probably a couple of
				other &quot;look&quot; points I'm ... over-looking, but aside
				from noting that
				</p>

				<p>(a) I did decide, albeit
				somewhat reluctantly, to use &quot;cascading stylesheets&quot;
				after Bill explained the underlying technotheology to me. <B><I>There
				are, however, a couple of hidden kickers w/r/t stylesheets:</I></B>
				As I found out far too late in the game, it turns out you have to
				be on-line for them to work right; had I known that at the outset
				I don't think I'dve gone to all the trouble to put 'em in. In the
				event, I also discovered that older browsers which are supposed
				to work with stylesheets don't work correctly even if you
				are on-line, so I proceeded to go to even more trouble to take
			'em out. [For some non-thesis-germane ruminations on all
				this, see, but only if you feel like it, <A HREF="digression.html">A
				Digression on Form and Discontent</A>.]</p>

				<p>and that</p>

				<p>(b) even more reluctantly as
				well as quite belatedly, I did decide to segment Chapters I and
				III into putatively more &quot;Web-friendly&quot; shorter
				portions (though not into anything as paltry as the Web-trendy,
				&quot;post-TV&quot;, preadolescent attention span-pandering
				little snippets that current fashion tries to dictate),
				</p>

			<p>the only other point I choose
				to make at this juncture is about the Content:</p>

				<p>On that score, the points I made in the '68 Prefatory Afterthoughts
still hold: for reasons of &quot;historical accuracy&quot; and/or
&quot;preservation&quot;, and of what must frankly be called
laziness, I've left the thesis, per se, alone. With one irresistible
exception a few years ago, it also seemed right to leave the
Prefatory Afterthoughts alone, even though they were written some eight
years after the thesis, per se.</p>

<p>(Time out, before what passes for the big finish, for a
just-recalled, moderately germane Treasured Memory, in order to avoid
giving in to the temptation to tinker even more with the Prefatory
Afterthoughts: Chapter III did see the dark of print in the interim
[with permission, of course], in the M.I.T. Science Fiction Society's
&quot;fanzine&quot;, <I>The Twilight Zine</I>, in 1963. Its length
had necessitated publication over two issues, actually, which led to
my getting to see--in the second issue, which I'd otherwise not have
received a copy of, not being a member of the Society--the highly
commendatory Letter to the Editor about the first segment that became
the Treasured Memory. The author observed that reading the detailed
analysis of <I>More Than Human</I> had made him realize how much
Sturgeon wrote like Faulkner ... or perhaps it was just that
Padlipsky wrote about Sturgeon the way &quot;the learned literary
men&quot; wrote about Faulkner. I loved it.)
</p>

<p>There is one, I dunno, call it a &quot;meta-irony&quot; that does
bear mention somewhere, though, and I guess here's the only place for
it, especially since it'll let me make a couple of points that I'm
itching to make: I really did have to fight to get to do the thesis
(well, make that The Thesis, by now--seems fair to me, anyway) in
'59, because Science Fiction was deemed to be of questionable
&quot;intellectual respectability&quot;. Indeed, I even had to agree
to alter the title--originally intended to be &quot;More Than Pulp
(?): [...]&quot;--to get the Department to let me do it, fond though
I was of that parenthetical question mark. By '85, however, when The
Book had been published by a &quot;real publisher&quot; (which I have
reason to believe paid me royalties on every other copy it sold,
b/t/w; &quot;just a little publisher humor&quot;--and reality), and
so had an apparently good opportunity to get The Thesis published as
well (the publisher being a textbook house), I was told that there
was no need for it anymore, since &quot;everybody knows&quot; science
fiction was legit lit. Well, let me say this about that: <B><I>even
now, I strongly suspect that almost nobody knows that science fiction
is legitimate literature, because almost everybody thinks that the
&quot;sci-fi&quot; crap &quot;Hollywood&quot; disgorges is what
science fiction is.</I></B></p>

<p>A somewhat Sibylline conclusion, then: On one of the two occasions
when I actually got to meet Sturgeon I had the opportunity to ask him
whether the Sturgeon's Law story was apocryphal. He said, &quot;No.
It's just as you heard it. I really was at a writers meeting and some
guy really did tell me I was a fine writer but why did I waste my
time on science fiction, didn't I know 90% of science fiction is
crap, and I really did reply 'Indeed, 90% of science fiction is crap;
however, 90% of everything is crap.'&quot; And so I got to tell him
Padlipsky's Corollary to Sturgeon's Law: &quot;Ted, you're an
optimist. The Law should be applied recursively: 90% of what's left
is no damn good.&quot; It earned me a smile. And it furnishes me with
if not a similie at least a punchline: <B><I>When it comes to that
which is labeled science fiction that's meant to be shown on a
screen, Padlipsky's Corollary should be applied recursively, too.</I></B></p>
