				<H3 align=center>Chapter
				III: Of Sturgeon and Other Fish, Some &quot;Close
				Readings&quot;</H3>
				<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
				<H4 align=center>A.
				Sturgeon</H4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
				<P>If I
				had to choose but one work on which to base my claim that science
				fiction does indeed contain works which possess literary merit,
				that work would be Theodore Sturgeon's  <I>More Than Human</I>.[1]
				As a matter of fact, my original intention was to do a thesis
				dealing only with close readings of science fiction works, of
				which the Sturgeon novel was to have furnished roughly half my
				material. When the issue of the &quot;intellectual
				respectability&quot; of science fiction arose, my plans were
				changed; but in view of the necessity of giving examples of
				literary merit in science fiction in order to complete the
				argument for the respectability of the field, I have been able to
				keep the novel in the discussion, if only as a test case.
				</P>
				<P>To
				illustrate the fairness of my choice of  <I>More Than Human</I> as
				representative of good science fiction--that is, to show that it
				belongs in the discussion for reasons other than the pun it
				furnishes for my title--I should like to mention what Damon
				Knight said about it in one of his essays, after quoting the
				first paragraph: &quot;My God, it's all like that, violins and
				stained glass and velvet and little needles in your throat&quot;
				(P. 80)-- this from a man whose difficultness to please is
				legendary among science fiction fans. The novel won a
				Hugo--awarded by science fiction fans at their annual conventions
				after the fashion of Hollywood's Oscars (the name Hugo is in
				honor of Hugo Gernsback, who introduced science fiction to the
				American magazines on a regular basis early in the century); it
				was also picked as the all-time favorite of English and American
				fans polled in 1956--on the basis of our  <I>Astounding</I> poll
				and England's  <I>Nebula</I> poll, taken on a weighted average.[2]
				So it's a pretty good work, according to people who are more
				serious &quot;addicts&quot; than Mr. Amis; and besides, <I>I</I>
				like it.
				</P>
				<P>Although
				this chapter is supposed to be dealing merely with the
				demonstration of the literary merit to be found in science
				fiction, I must admit that I shall &quot;sneak in&quot; some
				considerations not directly germane to the criteria implicitly
				based on Professor Beardsley's Affective and Objective Reasons. I
				crave the reader's indulgence in considering the digressions as
				further corroboration of the claims I made in Chapter I as to the
				content of science fiction.
				</P>
				<P>There
				are three parts to  <I>More Than Human</I>: &quot;The Fabulous
				Idiot,&quot; &quot;Baby Is Three,&quot; and &quot;Morality.&quot;
				In the first part we meet the Idiot, Lone, who is leading an
				aimless, drifting, idiot's existence, but who has &quot;something&quot;
				within him which is not yet functioning. An intangible &quot;call&quot;
				leads him to the home of Mr. Kew, a madman who has retreated from
				the world and is bringing up his two daughters in ignorance of
				it. The Idiot breaks through the wall surrounding the Kew place
				and meets Evelyn, the younger daughter; though he cannot talk and
				neither of them know the meaning of kissing, they sit together
				and are happy, until discovered by her father. The father whips
				the Idiot and beats his daughter to death; he then commits
				suicide, leaving his other daughter, Alicia, alone and terrified.
				A farmer, Prodd, takes the unconscious hulk of the Idiot in, and
				he and his wife nurse him back to health. They lavish much
				affection on him because the son they had expected &quot;was
				never born.&quot; While Lone is recuperating, several characters
				are introduced in tangential episodes: Gerry, who runs away from
				an orphanage because all he finds is hate; Hip Barrows, a
				brilliant boy whose disciplinarian father forces him to go to
				medical school although he is a talented engineer even without
				schooling; Janie, who is able to move objects telekinetically (by
				mental power) and hates her mother, Wilma, who is committing
				numerous adulteries while her husband is in World War II; and a
				pair of Negro twins who live in Janie's apartment house, and who
				are teleports (able to move from place to place by mental
				energy). Some time after Lone is cured and has developed limited
				telepathic powers so that he learns to speak with the Prodds, the
				Prodds are expecting a child and so Lone leaves them and builds a
				hut in the woods. To the hut eventually come Janie and the twins,
				and Lone takes them in. He also takes in the Prodds' child, a
				mongoloid in appearance, but able to communicate telepathically
				with Janie. Baby, as they call him, is akin to a computer which
				gathers and correlates information. In the course of questioning
				Baby, Lone discovers that he, Baby, Janie, and the twins comprise
				a gestalt organism which has far greater powers than the normal
				human individual.
				</P>
				<P>In the
				second part, we encounter Gerry again. He is in the office of Dr.
				Stern, a psychiatrist. After a long interview, Gerry discloses
				the history of the gestalt organism during the intervening time:
				Lone had taken him in, and had eventually died. The gestalt, with
				Gerry as its new &quot;head&quot; went to live with Alicia Kew,
				who owed them a favor according to Lone. Gerry subsequently kills
				her because she was ruining the rapport of the gestalt by giving
				it too easy an environment and trying to mother it. Because of
				the killing he has gone to Stern, and through Stern's questioning
				recalls Alicia's memories of her meeting with Lone, at which time
				he had ordered her to read many books, the contents of which he
				extracted from her telepathically; in return for her help. Lone
				had had intercourse with her, which was her unconscious wish to
				compensate for the horror in which her father had taught her to
				hold men. When Gerry had told her that &quot;Baby is three&quot;
				she began thinking wildly that her baby would have been three if
				she had conceived, and as Stern explained to him, so overloaded
				Gerry's latent telepathic faculties with her psychic blast that
				he suffered an &quot;occlusion&quot; and did not develop the
				faculties further, until he had overcome the occlusion through
				recounting it. He goes off to rejoin the kids, and to develop as
				best he can, though Stern warns him that without a sense of
				morality the gestalt will be as lonely as Lone was as an idiot.
				Gerry leaves, uncomprehending.
				</P>
				<P>In the
				third part, Hip is found in jail by Janie. She bails him out, and
				ministers to him during his apparent insanity, characterized by a
				compulsion to get sick and die. Through a working backward
				process, he eventually recalls that Gerry (whom he remembers as
				&quot;Thompson,&quot; the Air Force psychiatrist who had treated
				him) had induced the compulsion in him seven years before, when
				he had come across Prodd's old truck which was buried in an
				antiaircraft range, and which he discovered because an
				antigravity device with which Lone had fitted it was causing the
				proximity fuses of the shells to go haywire. Janie tells Hip that
				Gerry has become deranged, and takes him to Gerry in the hope of
				making Gerry ashamed. Hip, thinking it an intellectual exercise
				for himself, devises a code of ethics for the &quot;superman&quot;
				which Gerry extracts from his mind and accepts. Hip is
				incorporated into the gestalt as its conscience, and then the
				gestalt is accepted by the community of already existing gestalts
				for it has finally grown up.
				</P>
<h5>&nbsp;</h5>
				<H5 align=center>1.
				&quot;Objective Reasons&quot;</H5>
<h5>&nbsp;</h5>
				<P>The
				most striking characteristic of  <I>More Than Human</I> is the
				series of &quot;incompletenesses&quot; which run through it, not
				only of characters, but of philosophies, organisms, revelations,
				and other factors. The most obvious overt references to
				incompleteness are found in the descriptions of the Idiot, Lone,
				although we shall see that there are so many other instances that
				Incompleteness must be looked upon as a theme of the book.
				</P>
				<P>Lone
				is introduced as being something less than human, an idiot--a man
				manque, an incomplete person and personality. Further, &quot;Like
				a stone in a peach, a yolk in an egg, he carried another thing&quot;
				(pp 4-5), a thing which was useless to him, though: an &quot;inner
				ear&quot; receptive to &quot;murmuring, sending, speaking,
				sharing, from hundreds, from thousands of voices.&quot; Lone had
				a potentiality, but it is bottled up inside his idiot self and
				useless--his functioning is incomplete. Aside from the numerous
				instances of Lone's lacks and shortcomings (he enters the Prodds'
				diningroom nude for he has none of the social graces; he can
				neither read nor drive a truck), perhaps the most effective means
				of suggesting his incompleteness is that of not attaching to him
				a name until he has been the prominent figure of the novel for
				some twenty-seven pages; then, through the Prodd's ministrations
				and his own ability to sense what they want of him in a crude
				fashion at least, he overcomes his lack of speech to the extent
				of giving himself a name.
				</P>
				<P>Nor
				are the other characters presented in the first part complete.
				Mr. Kew has no sense of good; Alicia has no knowledge of the
				outside world, nor of what outsiders would call Truth; Evelyn
				&quot;knows no evil at all&quot;; neither daughter has what might
				be called a complete education for life. The Prodds are parents
				without a child. Gerry is a child without parents, a child with
				only hate and no love. Hip has talents but no goals, no
				aspirations. Janie has power but no control; her mother has no
				husband, in essence and later in fact. The twins cannot speak.
				And so on.
				</P>
				<P>The
				second and third parts follow the pattern. Gerry goes to the
				psychiatrist because his memories are incomplete, and because his
				knowledge is incomplete in that he wants to know why he killed
				Alicia. In Alicia's memories as related by Gerry, Lone says that
				he is waiting in the woods because he (as gestalt organism) isn't
				finished, but &quot;I don't mean 'finished' like you're thinking.
				I mean I ain't--completed yet.&quot; (p. 134) Stern tells Gerry
				he still lacks something--morality. In the third part, it is
				Hip's memory which is incomplete, and he himself is initially no
				longer functioning as a human being. Finally it is revealed that
				the Gerry-gestalt has been incomplete throughout, and only after
				it had incorporated Hip (as &quot;the small still voice&quot;)
				could it become individually complete and join the community of
				other gestalts (perhaps a good phrase would be &quot;<I>&uuml;ber-gestalt</I>&quot;),
				and achieve &quot;spiritual&quot; completeness ... there runs
				throughout the note sounded most overtly at the end of the first
				part: &quot;'Ask Baby what kind of people are all the time trying
				to find out what they are and what they belong to.' 'He says,
				<I>every</I> kind.'&quot; &quot;So it was that Lone came to know
				himself, and like the handful of people who have done so before
				him he found, at this pinnacle, the rugged foot of a mountain.&quot;
				(p. 76)
				</P>
				<P>The
				theme of incompleteness exists quite clearly in the work on the
				foregoing &quot;overt&quot; level, then. The first open test of
				Sturgeon's artistry is contained in the answer to a question
				which is a logical consequence of the theory of Chapter II: Does
				the &quot;form&quot; (the technique, the structure) of the work
				unify in the same way as the &quot;content&quot; (the plot, the
				action)? Or alternatively, is there unity of content and form? I
				believe the answer is yes. There are several different complexes
				of images and incidents quite directly related to the theme of
				incompleteness. Probably the most important of them is the
				complex of barriers.
				</P>
				<P>Two
				kinds of barriers occur in the book: physical and mental. The
				first is the barrier around Mr. Kew's retreat; it is with this
				that Lone struggles to penetrate, and through the struggle he
				achieves what amounts to his first &quot;rational&quot; thought:
				&quot;The fact that the barrier would not yield came to him
				slowly ... His mouth opened and a scratching sound emerged. He
				had never tried to speak before and could not now; the gesture
				was an end, not a means, like the starting of tears at a
				crescendo of music.&quot; (p. 10) Note that through the struggle
				with the physical barrier, he encounters, and partially
				overcomes, a mental barrier. Later, Lone is perplexed by the lack
				of a barrier between himself and Evelyn:
				</P>
				<BLOCKQUOTE>His
					bench-mark, his goal-point, had for years been that thing which
					happened to him on the bank of the pool. He had to understand
					that. If he could understand that, he was sure he could
					understand everything. Because for a second there was this
					<I>other</I>, and himself, and a flow between them without
					guards or screens or barriers--no language to stumble over, no
					ideas to misunderstand, nothing at all but a merging. (pp. 74-5)

					</P>
				</BLOCKQUOTE>
				<P>The
				final synthesis with the <I>&uuml;ber-gestalt</I> and the lesser
				triumph of &quot;bleshing&quot; (the blending and meshing process
				which is what the individuals in the gestalt do) are anticipated
				in the rather poetic merging of the idiot and the innocent--which
				is achieved by the dissolving of their interpersonal (and
				co-incidently, intra-personal) barriers.
