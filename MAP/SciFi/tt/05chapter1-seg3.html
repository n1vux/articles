							&quot;Artistic&quot; Arguments</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
							<P>There
							being more things in heaven (pun intended) and on Earth
							(ditto) than our philosophy, let us turn to the broader
							aspects of the issue of &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;
							writing. Finer observes that &quot;to couple St. Thomas More
							... with space fiction ... seems very shocking.&quot; The
							grounds for the shock are the differences in &quot;literary
							merit&quot; and in &quot;intention&quot;; he &quot;agrees&quot;
							that there is a difference in the former, but most of the
							remainder of his article is concerned with refuting the
							latter. I shall retain his term &quot;literary merit&quot; to
							apply to all the arguments which have been raised against the
							&quot;form&quot; or manner of presentation of science fiction.

							</P>
							<P>One
							objection frequently encountered is that the ideas somehow
							&quot;get in the way of the art.&quot; The one review in
							 <I>Spectator</I> which was fairly friendly to science fiction
							makes this point; the claim is that the characterization is
							weak, &quot;each hero is really a sawn-off version of Milton's
							Adam,&quot; and the prose is said to be secondary to the
							spilling out of ideas.[32] L. Michaelson, in an article
							entitled &quot;Social Criticism in Science Fiction,&quot;
							maintains in essence that the soapbox is a more highly
							esteemed vehicle than the &quot;literary&quot; approach, to
							the science fiction writer.[33] The last I shall mention in
							this regard is Fletcher Pratt, himself a science fiction
							writer, who speaks of &quot;this lack of realism in character
							[which] has led Bernard De Voto, probably the best literary
							critic in America, to describe it as 'a form of literature
							which has succeeded in almost completely doing away with
							emotion.'&quot;[34] Amis, who also mentions the bad writing to
							be found in science fiction but declares the October, 1958
							 <I>Astounding</I> to contain no stories which are &quot;offensive
							in style,&quot;[35] manages to strike the mark later on the
							subject of character. The reason for the lack of &quot;personality&quot;
							in much science fiction, he points out, is that the characters
							are simply symbols being employed by a satirist.[36]
														</P>
							<P>The
							symbolic, as opposed to &quot;realistic,&quot; nature of a
							character in a satire does not acquit the field from the bad
							writing charge. However, I would point out that even in a
							hypothetical story where the idea is intriguing but the prose
							is bad the evaluation of the piece is quite subjective,
							depending on whether the individual reader holds mental
							facility to be more important than fastidiousness of prose.
							(The hypothetical case is not too liable to transpire for, as
							someone whose identity I can't recall remarked, the authors
							are professionals involved in making a living selling their
							stories and would not get away with writing so poorly as the
							pulp contributors could in the days when the idea of even
							space travel was so new and exciting that the reader would not
							be at all bothered by a double negative or a misnomer or two.)
							It is perfectly possible to attach a higher value to content
							than to form so much as to be virtually unconcerned with the
							latter; however, one rarely, if one is a science fiction fan
							especially, goes the other way. As Isaac Asimov[37] points
							out, &quot;good writing&quot; does not make for good science
							fiction; nor, I hope, can a mainstream story be considered
							good if it offers polished form but a paucity of content. Art
							alone cannot <I>generate</I> ideas, but ideas can be presented
							unembellished and still affect the reader favorably, though of
							course embellishment can be an asset. So much for &quot;bad
							writing.&quot;
							</P>
							<P>Arthur
							Koestler at least does not simply give his opinions as
							pronouncements and let them rest on the weight of his
							reputation, as many of the others seem to do. He offers
							reasoned arguments for his condemnation of science fiction as
							art, which we shall now discuss. He claims:
							</P>
							<BLOCKQUOTE>Science
								fiction is good entertainment, [but] it will never become
								good art... Art means seeing the familiar in a new light,
								seeing tragedy in the trivial event; it means in the last
								resort to broaden and deepen our understanding of ourselves.
								</P>
							</BLOCKQUOTE>
							<P>His
							definition of art is similar to the one Rosalie Moore uses in
							<I>berating</I> mainstream fiction, in the Brettnor symposium:
							&quot;To put it in the crudest possible terms, the mainstream
							writer too frequently is concerned with saying, in the most
							sensitive possible terms, of course: 'Isn't it terribly
							sad?'.&quot; Now although Koestler's argument can be called
							reasoned in that it states its premises and proceeds from them
							in a logical fashion, and this is a far more agreeable
							procedure than the pronunciamenti encountered above, the
							argument cannot exactly be called reasonable for its premise
							is, though fashionable perhaps, quite suspect. Koestler has
							delineated <I>a</I> reasonable mode of artistic expression,
							one which is more or less attractive to an individual reader
							depending upon his personal prejudices; his mode is not,
							however, the only one. It seems that every literary discussion
							must mention Aristotle somewhere, and whatever one thinks of
							him in general, he still remains a pretty shrewd observer of
							the factors of art which most affect human beings. So a
							legitimate complementary view to Koestler's, though also not
							<I>the</I> only mode, can be offered in terms of Aristotle's
							criteria of importance or magnitude of characters:
							</P>
							<P>The
							heroes in science fiction frequently have world-shaking powers
							or positions of importance, although Rice's  <I>The Adding
							Machine</I> is one instance of a &quot;science fiction hero&quot;
							who is a lowly, unimportant bookkeeper. We are treating the
							general case, however, and Koestler is fairly accurate in
							inferring that most science fiction is not on the &quot;trivial,
							everyday&quot; scale (but see &quot;Poor Little Warrior&quot;
							for another interesting exception). Aristotle dictates kings
							and other &quot;high&quot; types as heroes, or protagonists if
							you prefer; now the titles are jettisonned, but the functions
							are the same as we frequently encounter in science fiction.
							The reason is clear, for a reader will far more readily
							identify himself with King Oedipus (if he isn't afraid of
							being accused of having the complex--but then &quot;Oedipus&quot;
							himself didn't) than with the sniveling little bookkeeper of
							Rice's modern play. As Knight says, &quot;Our undiminished
							wonder at the mystery which surrounds us is what makes us
							human. In science fiction we can approach that mystery, not in
							small, everyday symbols, but in the big ones of space and
							time.&quot;
							</P>
							<P>In
							terms of Aristotle's requirement of &quot;affirmation,&quot;
							and perhaps even <I>catharsis</I>, science fiction is again
							far more Aristotelian than most other modern work. The hero
							doesn't always win; but when, as happens often, he does, there
							the act is an affirmation, both within the story and to the
							author, of Barron's &quot;order in the universe&quot; and of
							Amis's &quot;pieties.&quot; Once again, the scale is the grand
							scale. Compare, for example, mainstream's  <I>The Last Angry
							Man</I> to Pohl and Kornbluth's highly praised (even by Amis)
							 <I>The Space Merchants</I>. In the former, Thrasher, the
							advertizing executive, finally returns to the fold of the
							agency, feebly insisting that he will do his best to inject a
							small note of dignity and social consciousness into the ad
							racket, although he admits to himself how little good it will
							do. In the latter, Mitchell Courtenay, &quot;star class
							copysmith,&quot; falls from his high position, but when he is
							raised again and even made president of the biggest
							advertising firm in the country (a position far outstripping
							that of the president of the United States in the postulated
							society of the book), he manages to give control of the
							colonization of Venus to the &quot;Conservationalists&quot;,
							and goes off to Venus with them to develop the planet along
							the lines of reason which were not followed in the rape of
							Earth's resources (much of which has happened already, in our
							real world of the present).
							</P>
							<P>The
							choice between not even saving one's self, and saving both
							one's self and a world in the bargain is not a hard one to
							make. Further, the former book does not have a more reasonable
							conclusion, based on the premise of the innate depravity of
							Man; in the latter book, the depravity is there and Earth is
							abandoned to it--but, men can be better than Man, and the
							affirmation of the conclusion is not only in consonance with
							the premise, but all the more compelling because of the
							necessity of renouncing the home planet (which operates
							perhaps symbolically, but not, I think, as the rejection of
							Mother or whatever it is the myth hunters would have us
							believe; it is perhaps a rebirth, but it is definitely not a
							regression).
							</P>
							<P>So
							Koestler's &quot;monadic&quot; view of art as restricted to
							the everyday is to be rejected even on the grounds that it is
							not a valid representation of reality, to say nothing of the
							moral values and audience-responses arguments which could be
							raised on our Aristotelian foundation. Koestler raised one
							other objection which would be worthwhile to consider, though
							he seems to be playing Amis's game of metaphor-making rather
							than arguing logically. He approves of  <I>Brave New World</I>,
							 <I>Gulliver</I>, and  <I>1984</I> because of their &quot;social
							message.&quot; They are &quot;great literature because in them
							the additions of alien worlds serve merely as a background...
							In other words, they are literature precisely to the extent
							which they are not science fiction, to which they are works of
							disciplined imagination and not fantasy.&quot; Knight replies
							to him directly, saying that the objection applies to all
							fiction and making the excellent point that &quot;science-fantasy
							is a form: what matters is what you put into it&quot; (p. 2).
							Granted, I would even say urged, that science fiction is
							concerned with <I>saying</I> things artistically, as opposed
							to saying things <I>artistically</I>;
							the problem is not science fiction's functional
							employment of literature: Rather, the problem is Koestler's
							suggested alternative approach of the sacrifice of content for
							form, the practice of almost-infinitely embellishing almost
							nothing at all; not art, but &quot;artsiness&quot; for its own
							sake--in short, the limit which Kostolefsky and I agree modern
							poetry tends to approach. The limit also toward which Koestler
							would, paradoxically, seem to be urging us when speaking of
							the finding of tragedy in trivia (bigger and bigger emotions
							evoked by smaller and smaller situations, as the artist's
							&quot;skill&quot; increases), yet against which he seems to be
							warning us by speaking of &quot;social message&quot; and of
							&quot;disciplined imagination.&quot;
							</P>
							<P>To
							conclude with Koestler: On the subject of universals versus
							trivia, I admit that I prefer artists to deal with universals
							because I have a personal inclination to agree with Shelley
							about the poet/artist's being the unacknowledged legislator
							for mankind--this shows that I may be naive, but at least my
							art's in the right place. Also, if Koestler had read works
							other than the apparently strictly adventure pulps about which
							he apologizes for his &quot;occasional addiction,&quot; and
							had read enough in the field to have grounds for his
							generalizations, he would probably have come across the works
							indicated in the Treguboff statistics, the Finer &quot;Profile,&quot;
							and the other samples cited above, which he would have found
							quite similar to  <I>Brave New World</I> and others which he
							likes. Had he done so, we would have been spared the last few
							pages, perhaps. However, we must be duly grateful to him, for
							the Aristotelian parallel he forced me to discover is a
							corroboratory point to the &quot;more than pulp&quot; thesis
							which far outweighs in importance the squandering of so much
							space on a relatively unimportant article. (Please note, as a
							parting shot, that the protagonist of Koestler's own  <I>Darkness
							at Noon</I> was no mere Party small fry himself; methinks the
							gentleman saith not as he doeth.)
						<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
							<h4 align=center>D.
							Summary and Conclusion</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
							<P>As
							advertized, the critical arguments against science fiction
							break down along the lines of objections to content and
							objections to form. Through cross-criticism and the
							injudicious employment of my own observations, I believe that
							the content aspect has been taken care of as thoroughly as can
							be managed under the circumstances. As to form, or &quot;literary
							merit,&quot; the general refutations can be made in like
							manner to the Koestler affair and bandied about as
							interminably as a mainstream-of-consciousness monologue.
							However, we have arrived at a point where my original
							intention of simply digging in and criticizing some specific
							science fiction stories is necessary to the conclusion of our
							inquiry. It would seem to be inescapable that we get down to
							cases, if we want to reach at all fairly a conclusion as to
							the literary value of science fiction; for, although the ideas
							to be found in it are often valuable, literary merit is also a
							very large factor in the adjudging of literary value--perhaps
							Koestler would suggest that it is the whole question.
							</P>
							<P>Now,
							it is impossible to analyze enough science fiction to reach an
							over-powering, clearcut conclusion here; but, after indicating
							briefly in the next chapter what literary value and merit are,
							I shall try to show that the requirements for conventional
							literary merit are met by some science fiction works. It is
							then assumed to be incumbent upon the critics to assess other
							works individually, for they have no excuse to ignore a field
							which even its detractors frequently call entertaining and
							which can be shown to have <I>some</I> (though probably no
							more than any other &quot;serious&quot; field) nuggets in it.
							To a miner intent upon enriching himself with the nuggets he
							finds, the dirt with which they may be surrounded is of small
							consequence. Knight's sensible credo is that &quot;science
							fiction is a field of literature worth taking seriously, and
							that ordinary critical standards can be meaningfully applied
							to it: e.g., originality, sincerity, style, construction,
							logic, coherence, sanity, garden-variety grammar.&quot; (p. 1)
							Even Amis, who had earlier said that &quot;stylistic adequacy
							is all one need demand from examples of the idea-category,
							which is not a vehicle for the verbal imagination&quot; (p.
							137) and missed the point of the artistic embellishment of
							ideas making them more effective, finally admits that:
							</P>
							<BLOCKQUOTE>A
								new volume by Pohl or Sheckley or Arthur Clarke ought, for
								instance, to be reviewed as general fiction, not tucked away,
								as one writer has put it, in something called &quot;Spaceman's
								Realm&quot; between the kiddy section and the dog stories.
								Hostile critics from outside the field will make public
								utterances upon it revealing a degree of ignorance that would
								never be tolerated if the subject were Indonesian pottery or
								Icelandic loan-words in Bantu. And, alongside the justifiable
								skepticism of the otherwise intelligent, considerable
								prejudice remains. That a badly produced pulp magazine can
								contain adult writing is a lesson not easy to learn, however
								often it may be spelled out. <BR>[pps. 149-50]
								</P>
							</BLOCKQUOTE>
							<P>Aside
							from observing that he abuses commas almost as badly as I do,
							perhaps all I can do is repeat my initial query: is there
							anything more we can ask?
