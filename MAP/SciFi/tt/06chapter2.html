				<H3 align=center>Chapter
				II: Of Theories and Reasons, Criteria for Literary
				Judgments</H3>
				<H3>&nbsp;</H3>
				<P>Without
				going into a thorough investigation of literary theory, I should
				like to clarify the difference between &quot;literary value&quot;
				and &quot;literary merit.&quot; This is not merely an exercise in
				semantic purity, for the distinction is necessary to the
				discovery of the criteria which we may apply below to some works
				of science fiction in order to determine if they are possessed of
				what is commonly called literary merit; for literary merit is the
				as yet unresolved issue on which a final verdict as to the worth
				of science fiction as literature hinges. 
				</P>
				<P>Literary
				merit as used above by Finer and others seems to apply solely to
				the &quot;artistic&quot; aspects of a piece of literature, that
				is to its form or mode of presentation. Literary value, for the
				present, can be thought of simply as the measure of the
				intellectual effects of a work, divorced from how well the ideas
				are presented by the work. The distinction is along the lines of
				form as opposed to content, the areas which separately contained
				the critical arguments discussed in Chapter I. In other words,
				what I am calling literary merit has its basis in the work
				itself, without relating what is said to external, real world,
				values; literary value, on the other hand, is concerned just with
				the relation of the work to the world. 
				</P>
				<P>The
				best way to get at the criteria for the assigning of literary
				merit is, I believe, by looking at the reasons which critics have
				offered for the general value judgment &quot;X is a good piece of
				literature.&quot; By virtue of the above definitions of literary
				value and merit, the reasons found which do not apply to value
				will be the basis for our literary merit criteria, for the two
				have been set up as exhaustive. Now the work of sorting out
				critical arguments over the ages would be far beyond the scope of
				this thesis; however, in his book  <I>Aesthetics</I> (see
				Bibliography), Professor Monroe Beardsley has done the work for
				us, and all we must do is report on the types of reasons he
				cites, and then extract those which pertain to literary merit. 
				</P>
				<P>Although
				only five in number, his grouping appears to be exhaustive. I
				shall merely list them, ignoring with one exception his arguments
				as to their efficacy in the critical process. 
				</P>
				<P>In the
				first place, a class of reasons can be given such as: 
				</P>
				<BLOCKQUOTE>It is
					profound.</P>
					<P>It
					has something important to say. 
					</P>
					<P>It
					conveys a significant view of life. 
					</P>
					<P>It
					gives insight into a universal human problem. 
					</P>
				</BLOCKQUOTE>
				<P>Beardsley
				has labeled these reasons Cognitive Value types, and I have
				borrowed the phrase for use in Chapter I. Arguments based upon
				the implicit acceptance of the cognitive value criterion were a
				major portion of the charges leveled against science fiction in
				my section on &quot;philosophical&quot; arguments. 
				</P>
				<P>A
				related type of reason could be formulated as follows: 
				</P>
				<BLOCKQUOTE>It is
					uplifting and inspiring. 
					</P>
					<P>It is
					morally edifying. 
					</P>
					<P>It
					promotes desirable social political ends. 
					</P>
					<P>It is
					subversive. 
					</P>
				</BLOCKQUOTE>
				<P>These
				are obviously based upon a work's Moral Value, and Professor
				Beardsley so labels the type. The importance of the moral aspects
				of a work of literature goes back at least as far as the  <I>Poetics</I>,
				and forward at least as far as the librarians of Chapter I. 
				</P>
				<P>The
				type of reasons which I shall include only for the completeness
				of the grouping, but then reject for further discussion, are
				those which Professor Beardsley mentions as being based on the
				artist's intentions, his powers of expression, workmanship,
				originality, or sincerity. These reasons which refer &quot;to
				something existing before the work itself, to the manner in which
				it was produced, or its connection with antecedent objects and
				psychological states&quot; he calls Genetic Reasons. They are
				less applicable in literature than in music or sculpture,
				probably, and at any rate the case has been frequently made that
				the intention of most artists is the continued care and feeding
				of the artist himself. Professor Beardsley gives two reasons why
				Genetic Reasons &quot;cannot be good, that is relevant and sound,
				reasons for critical evaluations.&quot; The first is that we
				cannot know the intention of the author with sufficient exactness
				to base an evaluation on it. The second, and I believe much
				stronger, objection is that even if we could determine the
				intention we would then be judging the worker and not the work.</P>
				<P>When a
				piece of literature is said to give pleasure, to be interesting,
				exciting, moving, stirring, or rousing, or when it is attributed
				a strong emotional impact, we are dealing with Affective Reasons.
				Beardsley says they refer &quot;to the psychological effects of
				the aesthetic object upon the percipient.&quot; The history of
				Affective Reasons is long and almost overwhelming: from
				Aristotle's treatment of catharsis to Pater's &quot;power of
				being deeply moved by beautiful objects.&quot; Although the
				introduction of virtually any psychology can furnish the grounds
				for specifying and explaining them (I must confess a distinct
				partiality to Freud's, myself) and make them quite respectable,
				Affective Reasons can be appealed to to cover a multitude of
				vacuous formulations, and for this reason Professor Beardsiey
				objects to them. 
				</P>
				<P>The
				final class of reasons according to Professor Beardsley are
				Objective Reasons, which refer &quot;to some characteristic--that
				is, some quality of internal relation, or set of qualities and
				relations--within the work itself, or to some meaning-relation
				between the work and the world.&quot; He cites three kinds, or
				sub-types, of Objective Reasons: Unity, Complexity, and
				Intensity; he then claims that all Objective Reasons may be
				subsumed under one or the other of these heads. The types of
				Objective Reasons are those appealed to, frequently implicitly,
				by &quot;New Critics,&quot; &quot;close readers,&quot;
				&quot;analytical critics&quot; (in Empson's usage), or whatever
				you choose to call them. Actually, it might be observed, the
				connotations of &quot;objectivity&quot; are somewhat of a
				misapellation. The Objective Reasons can probably be viewed as a
				special type of Affective Reasons, with the general classes of
				the former being canons abstracted from factors which commonly
				have psychological appeal. Freud's essay on &quot;Wit and Its
				Relation to the Unconscious, &quot; for example, suggests that
				the finding of Unity (and especially as a resolution of
				Complexity) is of universal appeal. 
				</P>
				<P>There
				are apparently no other criteria commonly used in the evaluation
				of literature. Now, clearly Professor Beardsley's first two
				types, referring as they do to the content of the work, are the
				criteria for literary value in the diminished sense of the term
				which we are tentatively employing. The final two represent the
				sought-for criteria for literary <I>merit</I>, as they refer to
				formal qualities of the work. That is, the features of unity,
				complexity, intensity, and &quot;pleasurable&quot; effects are
				the indicators of literary merit for which we shall look. 
				</P>
				<P>We
				have found four usable critical criteria, then, and have seen in
				Chapter I that works of science fiction can and do satisfy the
				first two of them (in regard to Cognitive and Moral Values).
				Before applying the Affective and Objective criteria to a few
				science fiction works in order to test their literary merit, I
				should like to stress the fact that literary merit is not the
				<I>sole</I> criterion for stating that &quot;X is good
				literature,&quot; that is for the finding of literary value as
				the term is more commonly used, &quot;art for art's sake&quot;
				claims notwithstanding. It is not &quot;necessary&quot; in the
				logical sense of the word, for a value judgment can and has been
				based solely on, say, the moral value of a work. Nor is it
				&quot;sufficient,&quot; I would claim, for the &quot;literarily
				valuable&quot; label is not to be applied to works which say
				nothing, but do so in a literarily meritorious way. 
				</P>
				<P>Let us
				observe, then, that there are no individually hard and fast
				criteria for literary value, in the broad sense implied by the
				title of this thesis, as any reason may strike a particular
				reader as being sufficient in a particular case. However, a work
				which satisfies <I>all</I> the criteria implied by the &quot;reasons&quot;
				has a very high likelihood of warranting an affirmative decision
				as to its literary value, even in the broader sense implied by my
				title. Let us turn to such a work.</P>
