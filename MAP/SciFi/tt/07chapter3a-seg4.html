				&quot;Affective Reasons&quot;</H5>
<h5>&nbsp;</h5>
				<P>It
				would be easy to say simply that I found the plot of  <I>More Than
				Human </I>&quot;intriguing,&quot; the final affirmation
				&quot;uplifting,&quot; and the prose &quot;scintillating&quot;--to
				borrow some phrases. It would also defeat the purpose of this
				paper, which is an attempt to establish that science fiction, at
				least occasionally, has literary merit. While the &quot;objective
				reasons&quot; cited above may not be convincing alone, an
				attempt to specify several of the grounds on which the book may
				be expected to appeal psychologically to most readers should be
				adequate to tip the balance. An induction based on introspection,
				which is what I propose to perform, is admittedly lacking in
				philosophical rigor; but it is also what most critics seem to do
				when they make a value judgement. The best I can do, then, is
				merely to list and comment on some of the features of the novel
				which strike me as appealing.</P>
				<P>To
				begin, I must make two confessions; one of them has no effect on
				the value judgement, the other does but need not be endorsed by
				the reader. That is, 1) I find myself in sympathy with the
				humanistic philosophy with which the book ends and which is a
				necessary result of the context which is established; and 2) I am
				to a large extent in sympathy with those literary critics who
				apply psychoanalytic considerations in their criticism.</P>
				<P>Now
				the philosophy expressed or implied by a work of art should not
				detract from its artistic merit, but may even <I>add</I> to it if
				the presentation is skillful. As an example, let us note that Mr.
				Nabakov is not Humbert Humbert; whether or not nymphetophilia
				repels us does not detract from the skill with which the author
				maintains his persona and rationalizes its views to itself, and I
				am ashamed to even mention the possiblity of a reader's
				reacting to  <I>Lolita</I> by
				piously proclaiming that we really shouldn't aIl go out and
				seduce twelve year olds and that Mr. Nabakov is simply disgusting
				for even suggesting it. By the same token, Sturgeon is to be
				commended for his development of the proposition that humanity
				must be considered to be the parent of its evolutionary successor
				not because we as readers prefer humanism to the God of the Old
				or New Testaments or to the Proletariat or to the Almighty
				Dollar, but because he has underpinned the need for a parent in
				the broken family relationships which were causal links in the
				formation of the gestalt emotionally, and in the importance of
				species survival philosophically. My personal endorsement of the
				philosophy has, as I said, no bearing on the value judgment I
				shall finally make; but the artist's presentation of it is
				a distinct plus value for the novel.</P>
				<P>As to
				the appeal of the plot, my second confession does have a bearing.
				In psychoanalytic terms, the &quot;humanizing' of Lone in
				Part One represents a discovery of the familiar, which Freud (in
				&quot;Wit and Its Relation to the Unconscious&quot;) posits as
				being pleasurable in itself. The supernormal powers of Lone and
				especially of Gerry in Part Two appeals to the childhood fantasy
				of the omnipotence of thoughts, and the pleasure of vicariously
				experiencing Gerry's omnipotence (which is effected through
				thought) is sufficient to compensate for the distaste one feels
				for his nastiness. (I omit sadistic appeal on the grounds of
				slight relevance to plot, and also because most readers probably
				would not admit to feeling it.) Finally, Gerry becomes
				&quot;humanized&quot; and becomes part of an omnipotent
				thinker, thus appealing to both of the principles which underlie
				the appeals of the first two parts. The idiocy of Lone and the
				nastiness of Gerry give rise to a superficial weakness of the
				book in that the reader is less likely to identify with them.
				However, not only can he enjoy feeling superior to Lone (for a
				while) and being powerful with Gerry, but also when the rather
				conventionally &quot;human&quot; character of Hip bcomes the
				major character in Part Three and the unhuman gestalt becomes
				humanized at the end, the reader is both relieved and satisfied
				by the affirmation. In rule-of-thumb psychological terms, the
				alien quality of Lone and Gerry operates as a goad, pushing the
				reader into sympathy with Hip, and into sympathy--though not
				necessarily belief--with the conclusion.</P>
				<P>I
				should like to consider three other major areas which seem to
				furnish grounds for general psychological appeal before simply
				tossing into the pot some random factors which I enjoyed and
				which I think may well be shared by most readers. The first of
				these is &quot;magic.&quot; Quite possibly an off-shoot of the
				omnipotence of thought fantasy, magical phenomena are enjoyable
				to contemplate, and their vicarious performance is appealing
				psychologically. Things magical proliferate in  <I>MoreThan Human</I>:
				the mind-reading eyes &quot;with their irises just about to
				spin&quot; of Lone and Gerry; the call Lone feels which leads
				him to Evelyn; the &quot;miracles&quot; of Lone's
				&quot;growing up,&quot; as the Prodds call them; Janie's
				telekinetic powers; the twins' teleportation. Not only are
				there the concrete instances just mentioned, but also there are
				the magical associations enjoyed by the concept of immortality,
				and by the giving of names to things (magically gaining power
				over them) which goes on throughout. To be brief, there is magic
				in the book and magic is fun.</P>
				<P>Second,
				there is the area of mystery. The many examples cited as
				incomplete revelations earlier need not be rehashed. Let us note,
				however, that they all lend an air of mystery to the enterprise.
				Who is Thompson? Why is Janie interested in Hip? The natural
				desire of the reader to learn the answers gives a sense of speed,
				of pace, to the book. One rushes from revelation to revelation,
				carried along with the tide of the action. The presence of
				mystery or &quot;suspense&quot; in a piece of literature is also
				grounds for psychological appeal.</P>
				<P>Third,
				and perhaps less clearly appealling, is the area of syntax or
				diction--the problem of <I>how</I> the author &quot;says&quot;
				what he says. There are two aspects here: First is the &quot;mood,&quot;
				or tone, of the narration, which should relate to the action to
				qualify as good style--form complementing content if you will.
				Even a cursory examination shows that this is indeed the case:
				the opening pages are slow and hazy, the descriptions indirect,
				suggesting the lost and aimless existence of the Idiot; Mr. Key
				is dealt with in a straight exposition, befitting his crudeness;
				Evelyn appears in &quot;poetic&quot; passages, as she is an
				innocent and hence the object of at least one sort of poetry;
				Gerry snaps at Stern when called Sonny, &quot;Look, if a midget
				walks in here, what do you say--sit over there, Shorty?&quot;
				(p. 79) thus establishing a proper hostility toward the
				therapist; the sheriff's abominable grammar show him up as
				a no-good, and gives a comic tone because of the contrast with
				his attempted gravity; and as a last example, Hip's grammar
				starts off as bad as the sheriff's (though he regains his
				powers of clear speech soon), suggesting his beaten condition.</P>
				<P>In the
				second aspect of the syntax lies the problem: that is, the
				so-called &quot;poetic prose&quot; which occurs here and there
				throughout the book. Not only is it difficult to define what is
				meant by &quot;poetic&quot; prose except by pointing at it, but
				some readers may feel that its use is an affectation, rather than
				a contribution to the whole of the work. In an instance such as
				the first paragraph of the book which was applauded by Demon
				Knight, the justification is clear in terms of mood:</P>
				<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.39in">The
				idiot lived in a black and gray world, punctuated by the white
				lightning of hunger and the flickering of fear. His clothes were
				old and many-windowed. Here peeped a shinbone, sharp as a cold
				chisel, and there in the torn coat were ribs like the fingers of
				a fist. He was tall and flat. His eyes were calm and his face was
				dead. [p. 3]</P>
				<P>The
				disembodied impression induced by the indirect description and
				the imagery of the &quot;black and gray world&quot; and the
				&quot;white lightning&quot; place the Idiot in an
				other-worldly, unhuman context. The paradox of finding at a
				pinnacle the rugged foot of a mountain is also an effective
				image, suggesting the further &quot;climb&quot; which the
				gestalt is to undergo in the final parts of the book before it
				succeeds in knowing itself. A possibly bad example is Gerry's
				saying, when recounting to Stern his meeting with Lone and the
				kids, &quot;The air had a haze of smoke and such a wonderful
				heart-breaking, candy-and-crackling smell of food that a little
				hose squirted inside my mouth.&quot; (p. 88) Such a description
				is apparently not in keeping with Gerry's &quot;nasty&quot;
				character. However, this weakness is also a possible strength,
				for &quot;poetry&quot; has been associated with &quot;goodness&quot;
				through Evelyn, and the suggestion would seem to be that even
				Gerry has a latent, balancing modicum of goodness in him. This is
				reasonable, for if Gerry had been depicted as entirely bad, the
				final conversion to and acceptance of the ethos would be
				implausible.</P>
				<P>Whether
				or not the majority of readers will agree with my general
				personal preference for &quot;poetic prose&quot; actually has
				very little bearing on the overall effect of the book on them.
				The &quot;poetic prose&quot; is a <I>possible</I> plus-value,
				but is not grounds for condemnation as its use, whether
				appreciated by the individual reader or not, can be justified in
				terms of the unities of the book.</P>
				<P>To
				conclude the discussion of Affective Reasons, I should like to
				note four &quot;gimmicks&quot; which Sturgeon employs in
				various places which strike me as being effective touches--as
				evoking approbation, if you will. Most obvious of these is his
				use of meaningful names. &quot;Kew&quot; can be taken as
				punning on &quot;cue,&quot; in the sense that the Kews furnish
				Lone's cue for getting into the real world and eventually
				becoming human. There might also be a covert reference to Kew,
				the place, which is noted for its botanical gardens, for the
				trees around the estate and its foliage in general are important
				to the complex of Nature images. Prodd, of course, has only to
				lose the final &quot;d&quot; to describe literally what the
				Prodds do to Lone--they prod him out of his withdrawn state, out
				of his idiocy and into a reasonable facsimile of a comunicating
				human being. Stern is a beautiful name for an authority figure
				such as a psychiatrist. &quot;Hip&quot; connotes precisely the
				&quot;wiseguy&quot; nature of the young Hip Barrows to one
				familiar wtth the jazz idiom. Also, there is the possible pun
				from Janie to genie.</P>
				<P>The
				multifarious barriers noted previously suggest to a fairly great
				extent a sexual symbolism. The penetration of barriers,
				especially in the case of Alicia, lends a covert air of sexual
				triumph to the enterprise. This consideration also would hold in
				terms of the telepathic process of which Lone and Gerry are
				capable, which is called &quot;That--'opening up'
				thing&quot; by Alicia at one point; &quot;super&quot; mental
				powers are common sexual fantasies. An overtone, granted, but one
				which probably elicits an unconscious response from the reader.</P>
				<P>When
				Hip establishes dominance over Gerry, the symbol of authority is
				an eleven inch long knife procured for him by one of the twins.
				Much as I am loath to introduce cocktail party Freudianism into
				this discussion, it must be noted that there could be no more apt
				symbol of the acquisition of mastery than an eleven inch long,
				terribly phallic, knife. It's a very neat touch.</P>
				<P>Finally,
				I should like to consider an overtone suggested by the repeated
				use of the same numbers throughout. Aside from a few &quot;mystic&quot;
				threes and sevens, the number which is thoroughly dominant is
				four. It takes the twins four days to develop their powers. Janie
				has to tell everything to Lone four times. The truck breaks down
				four times. Hip hadn't eaten for four days, and so on. The
				most important use of four-ness is not mentioned overtly,
				however. It is the composition of the gestalt itself, which has a
				head (Lone or Gerry), a memory (Baby), environment manipulators
				(Janie and the twins), and a conscience (Hip). Lumping Janie and
				the twins together may seem forced, but the title of the second
				part of the book (before Hip is integrated) <I>is</I> &quot;Baby
				is Three&quot; and the suggestion is fairly clear. The
				importance of the tetrapartite nature of the gestalt organism and
				its being emphasized by all the other fours' cropping up is
				probably best accounted for in Jungian terms. The similarity of
				the <I>&uuml;ber-gestalt</I> to the Jungian collective
				unconscious is not too farfetched, and with Jung on the scene due
				note must be taken of his notion of the mandala--&quot;The
				'magic circle' which in all cultures, even the most
				primitive, seems to represent a wholeness to which parts
				contribute in an essentially fourfold manner&quot;[3] according
				to a commentator. Children's drawings of people are
				supposed to be strongly influenced by the mandala: &quot;In
				their drawings of people the circular head comes first, later
				elaborated by legs, then by trunk and arms. The four limbs are
				very prominent, at first with little attention to body
				proportions.&quot;[4] So the reason for the &quot;rightness&quot;
				of all the fours we find would seem to be that the number has
				connotations of wholeness and unity by virtue of its association
				with the mandala. The explanation may be over-ingenious, but the
				overpowering numerousness of fours in the book required note, and
				my explanation makes sense in the context of the book as process
				of unification. The fact that such connotations do apply to fours
				indicates that, whether or not he was conscious of it, Sturgeon's
				frequent use of them is both significant and, perhaps, effective.
				Once again, however, the general reader-effect is hard to
				estimate.</P>
				<P>Simply
				because the discussion <I>could</I> be so long, the above
				treatment of &quot;affective reasons&quot; has been
				deliberately kept quite short. There are probably as many grounds
				for psychological appeal as there are readers of any piece of
				literature, however, so the argument is not completable anyway.
				My suggestions do not intentionally omit any positive points; nor
				do they intentionally omit any possible grounds for adverse
				reactions which I think may occur.</P>
				<P>Due to
				the complexity of the question of style on any level, I have
				merely mentioned some of the points which struck me as good and
				have sidestepped the larger problem of &quot;style&quot; in
				general. Also, I have minimized the knotty problem of &quot;poetic
				prose,&quot; as both the very definition of it and also its
				realm of application are quite subjective. Unless there are
				reasons dictated by the work's context for not using it, I
				enjoy poetic prose for itself ..... and at least some of
				Sturgeon's uses <I>are</I> complementary to the content.</P>
				<P>A
				further reason for not going into more of the ramifications of
				the Affective Reasons is that it is unnecessary to do so in the
				frame of reference of this paper. We are merely attempting to
				determine the presence or absence of literary merit in science
				fiction. We are not looking for greatness, merely goodness.
				Suffice it to say that there are no serious objections to  <I>More
				Than Human</I> and that by normal critical standards it is a good
				book--it <I>has</I> literary merit.</P>
