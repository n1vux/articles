				... And Other Fish</H4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
				<P>In the
				following four brief analyses, I shall not endeavor to trace out
				the indicators of literary merit to the extent which I did above.
				Rather, I shall attempt to indicate briefly both the cognitive
				aspects of the stories and their technical aspects, in order to
				present them in the light of &quot;good&quot; works of
				literature, following all four of the accepted criteria of
				Chapter II. The examples, by the way, are not picked because of
				any special claims to greatness they may have, but merely to show
				that good stories are to be found readily in science fiction if
				you look for them with an open mind--and also as counterexamples
				to some of the allegations cited in Chapter I. 
				</P>

				&quot;Disappearing Act&quot;</H5>
<h5>&nbsp;</h5>
				<P>Alfred
				Bester writes for radio and television,  <I>Holiday</I>
				(columnist), and has done some highly praised science fiction,
				including the Hugo-winning novel,  <I>The Demolished Man</I>.
				&quot;Disappearing Act&quot; is one of eleven of his short
				stories appearing in  <I>Starburst</I>.(Signet Books, New York,
				1958) In it, a war is being fought: &quot;This one wasn't the
				last war or a war to end war. They called it the War for the
				American Dream.&quot; The war, given the date 2112 later, is
				being run by a General Carpenter: 
				</P>
				<BLOCKQUOTE>There
					are fighting generals (vital to an army), political genera1s
					(vital to an admnistration), and public relations generals
					(vital to a war). General Carpenter was a master of public
					relations. Forthright and Four-Square, he had ideals as high and
					as understandable as the mottoes on money. In the mind of
					America he <I>was</I> the army, the administration, the nation's
					shield and sword and stout right arm.. His ideal was the
					American Dream. 
					</P>
				</BLOCKQUOTE>
				<P>The
				note of the American Dream is sounded throughout; to give just
				one example, &quot;We are struggling for the Ideal of
				civilization; for Culture, for Poetry, for the Only Things Worth
				Preserving.&quot; He is continually calling for experts: &quot;Every
				man and woman must be a specific tool for a specific job.&quot;
				The climax of the war, the narration informs us, takes place in a
				ward of an Army Hospital. To do an injustice to the story, and
				skipping the detail and order of presentation, what happens is,
				briefly, this: the patients have been disappearing from the ward.
				Thinking he is onto teleportation, Carpenter assigns experts to
				the ward to find out what's happening; one of them overhears a
				reference to Diamond Jim Brady (the reader has already been
				presented with three scenes following three of the patients in
				the &quot;past&quot;). After going through a Lapidary, a
				Semanticist, a Genealogist, and an Archaeologist, he finally is
				referred to an Historian, Bradley Scrim, who had been at twenty
				years hard labor, who identifies the man. The historian then is
				sent to the ward and comes back the next night to dispel
				Carpenter's notion that they have time travel as a weapon for the
				war by explaining that the &quot;pasts&quot; are thoroughly
				anachronistic--Brady coexisting with the Eisenhower election,
				Disraeli in a Rolls Royce with another of the patients--and says,
				'My God, Carpenter, <I>this</I> is your American dream. It's
				miracle-working, immortality, Godlike creation ...&quot; But,
				Scrim continues, he can't figure out how to do it himself; a poet
				is needed, &quot;an artist who understands the creation of
				dreams&quot; (no scientism here!): 
				</P>
				<BLOCKQUOTE>Carpenter
					snapped up his intercom. &quot;Send me a poet, &quot; he said
					... He waited, and waited ... and waited ... while America
					sorted feverishly through its two hundred and ninety millions of
					hardened and sharpened experts, its specialized tools to defend
					the American Dream of Beauty and Poetry and the Better Things of
					Life. He waited for them to find a poet, not understanding the
					endless delay, the fruitless search; not understanding why
					Bradley Scrim laughed and laughed and laughed at this final,
					fatal disappearance. 
					</P>
				</BLOCKQUOTE>
				<P>End of
				story. 
				</P>
				<P>Now,
				there are two types of satire operating here: The first is a
				general sort, good more for laughs than for thoughts; the second
				is social satire of a rather high order. To give a few examples
				of the first sort: &quot;Our Dream,&quot; says Carpenter, &quot;is
				at one with the gentle Greeks of Athens, with the noble Romans of
				... er ... Rome.&quot; The army has sorted out all the possible
				kinds of injury, and segregates them into wards A through S;
				naturally, the dreamers are in Ward T. When Carpenter first sees
				three patients disappear, he calls for a combat-shock expert and
				an alienist; the first says, &quot;War jitters,&quot; and the
				second, &quot;Mass illusion,&quot; in perfectly stereotyped
				manner which scarcely requires an &quot;expert&quot; to parrot.
				But the broadest satire of all is Carpenter himself: he is so
				stultified by his reliance on experts that he starts to call for
				an Entomologist when Scrim says, &quot;I'm the last singing
				grasshopper in the ant heap&quot;; he goes through a full five
				experts to identify Brady; he is a parrot, a nothing who is
				shocked when Scrim talks about a poet's being needed, who doesn't
				understand when Scrim answers his &quot;We're fighting for Poetry
				and Culture and Education and the Finer Things in Life&quot; line
				with &quot;Which means you're fighting to preserve me ...That's
				what I've devoted my life to. And what do you do with me? Put me
				in jail.&quot; 
				</P>
				<P>The
				whole &quot;tool chest&quot; refrain wherein every man and woman
				is a &quot;tool&quot; trained for a job is one of the tools of
				Bester's social satire. When &quot;the experts worked over
				Dimmock [the director of the hospital] with pre-conscious
				softeners, id releases and superego blocks&quot; followed by
				&quot;every form of physical and mental pressure,&quot; but
				boggle at applying &quot;pressure to the sick men and the woman,&quot;
				Carpenter rages &quot;For God's sake, don't be squeamish. We're
				fighting a war for civilization. We've got to protect our ideals
				no matter what the price. Get to it!&quot; The American Dream
				becomes an object of scorn in being talked about as &quot;theory&quot;
				but ignored in practice; however, the criticism is not merely
				domestic--it applies to the whole political farce of false,
				resounding labels. 
				</P>
				<P>Technically,
				Bester performs beautifully. Perhaps the most obvious point is
				the pun in the title, applying it both to the patients and
				ultimately to the American Dream--both of which disappear from
				the &quot;real&quot; world. He also does a good deal with pace:
				Carpenter's staccato sentences suggest both command and
				emptiness, simpleness; when Scrim is explaining that the patients
				are visiting anachronistic &quot;pasts&quot;--and the process is
				a painful one because Carpenter isn't too bright--the passage is
				punctuated with one-sentence paragraphs as follow: &quot;Carpenter
				nodded ... Carpenter looked expectant ... Carpenter looked
				puzzled ... Carpenter goggled.&quot; Also, for his satire he is
				relying on the technique of &quot;extrapolation,&quot; but they
				are quite different from Sturgeon's evolutionary exptrapolations;
				over-specialization, taking <I>a</I> general to represent <I>the</I>
				Army, and the substitution of slogans for ideals are all present
				today although they have not expanded to the point which Bester
				portrays in the story ...or have they? 
				</P>
				<P>Another
				&quot;technical &quot; point lies in Carpenter's name, in which a
				double allusion seems to operate: to John Crowe Ransom's poem
				&quot;Captain Carpenter,&quot; and through its quixotic Christ
				figure back to the original (but in this case the Saviour doesn't
				save). 
				</P>
<h5>&nbsp;</h5>
				<H5 align=center>2.
				&quot;Poor Little Warrior&quot;</H5>
<h5>&nbsp;</h5>
				<P>Another
				good anthology is Brian Aldiss's  <I>No Time Like Tomorrow</I>
				(also Signet, same price, 1959). Aldiss won a special plaque at
				the last World Science Fiction Convention as &quot;the year's
				most promising writer,&quot; and is also Literary Editor of the
				 <I>Oxford Mail</I>. The plot of &quot;Poor Little Warrior&quot;
				can be recounted quite succinctly: Claude Ford is hunting a
				brontosaurus, having travelled back in a twenty-second century
				travel agency's time machine. He is a failure in life, unhappily
				married and unable to stand &quot;the whole awful, hopeless
				business of trying to adjust to an overcomplex environment, of
				trying to turn yourself into a cog.&quot; Though he finds the
				bronto awesome, he kills it anyway, hoping to achieve some sort
				of catharsis--which he does not do: &quot;Poor little warrior,
				science will never invent anything to assist the titanic death
				you want in the contra-terrene caverns of your
				fee-fi-fo-fumblingly fearful id!&quot; Before returning to his
				time-mobile, he turns back to the dead creature, regretting the
				necessity of returning to his wife Maude, and the whole mess of
				2181 AD: 
				</P>
				<BLOCKQUOTE>So
					you pause, and as you pause, something lands socko on your back,
					pitching you face forward into tasty mud. You struggle and
					scream as lobster claws tear at your neck and throat. You try to
					pick up the rifle but cannot, so in agony you roll over, and
					next second the crab-thing is greedying it on your chest. You
					wrench at its shell, but it giggles and pecks your fingers off.
					You forgot when you killed the bronto that its parasites would
					leave it, and that to a little shrimp like you they would be a
					deal more dangerous than their host. You do your best, kicking
					for at least three minutes. By the end of that time there is a
					whole pack of the creatures on you. Already they are picking
					your carcass loving clean. You're going to like it up there on
					top of the Rockies; you won't feel a thing. 
					</P>
				</BLOCKQUOTE>
				<P>The
				most striking feature of the story is its diction, especially its
				overwhelming number of almost Joycean puns. They have two
				characteristics: at the beginning of the story the puns run to
				the almost preciously clever; by the end, they are malignantly
				sardonic. In the beginning, there is a play on Claude's hearing
				the bronto's heart beat &quot;as the ventricle keeps miraculous
				time with the auricle. [Paragraph] Time for listening to the
				oracle is past ...&quot; In reference to the dung-eating parasite
				birds, the close of a mock-travelogue which was describing their
				process: &quot;and now as the sun stinks in the Jurassic West, we
				say 'Fare well on that diet . . .'&quot; By the end (the story is
				only five pages long), the birds leave the dead bronto: &quot;They
				know when a good thing turns bad, and do not wait for the
				vultures to drive them off; all hope abandon, ye who entrail
				here.&quot; And the final play is on the grotesque image of the
				<I>crab</I>-things eating &quot;a little shrimp like you.&quot; 
				</P>
				<P>There
				is more to the story than meets the paranomasiac's eye, though.
				There is double-edged satire operating, both on the weak
				individual who tries to &quot;escape&quot; the real world and on
				the society which not only drives him out but also provides a
				commercial means for doing it. The &quot;moral &quot;, if you
				will, seems to be &quot;Thus be it with all escapists&quot;; so
				the story can be read both as a personal tragedy, on the
				&quot;everyday&quot; level demanded by Arthur Koestler, and as
				one which is universal in application. Whatever the source of his
				psychological needs, his own weakness or Society's
				over-complexity, Claude's tragedy is amplified by the fact that
				he is legitimately trying to prove himself a man, to assert
				himself, to combat Nature . . . and he fails so miserably. The
				final mock-solace of &quot;you won't feel a thing&quot; heightens
				the effect, for in a sense his death solves all his problems,
				though perhaps not in exactly the way he had intended. 
				</P>
				<P>Aldiss
				employs a technical device in inducing both the sense of tragedy
				and the satire which bears mention. He accomplishes a complete
				shift in tone from the matter-of-fact &quot;Man--though perhaps
				contemptible--dominating Nature&quot; tone of the opening to the
				tragic &quot;Man powerless and thoroughly dominated by Nature&quot;
				tone of the close. This is managed syntactically, by employing a
				nominal second-person narration throughout but playing on the
				properties of &quot;you&quot; as a pseudo first-person and pseudo
				third-person. That is, he starts &quot;Claude Ford knew exactly
				how it was to hunt a bronto-saurus. You crawled heedlessly
				through the mud among the willows . . .&quot; The &quot;you&quot;
				represents the generalized third-person &quot;one&quot;, or, in
				other words, represents the first-person to the speaker; in the
				middle of the story, the &quot;you&quot; becomes accusing (though
				not accusative). &quot;This time the bogey-man is real, Claude,
				just as you wanted it to be, and this time you really have to
				face up to it before it turns and faces you again.&quot; Though
				the shift may not be unambiguous earlier in the story (the above
				occurs almost exactly halfway through), here is marked the
				beginning of the vicious criticism which builds to the
				wonderfully mocking &quot;Poor little warrior&quot; line. 
				</P>
				<P>A
				final point about the applicability of the story is hinted at by
				the description of the bronto's eyes after Claude has shot it:
				&quot;With no indecision, those century-old lights, dim and
				sacred, go out. Those cloisters are closed till Judgment Day.&quot;
				If you're fond of allegory, or partial to Freud's  <I>Totem and
				Taboo</I>, the bronto can represent God, herein ritually (and
				actually) slain; but without God, man is the prey of the
				universe, hence the parasites are freed to kill Claude. Aside
				from the religious terms just quoted, there is a bit of internal
				evidence in the line &quot;God, if adolescence did not exist it
				would be unnecessary to invent it!&quot; and the atheistic
				sentiment from which it is derived. Although it's cheating, I
				can't resist pointing out that there is a good deal of
				Nietzschean influence in at least three of his other
				stories--which are concerned more or less with dying at the right
				time (&quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot;)--, and the &quot;God is
				dead&quot; line comes from the same place. 
				</P>
				<P>Of the
				grounds for recommending the story, two have been mentioned
				briefly: personal tragedy, and the satirizing of an undesirable
				individual (which are not at all incompatible). Two others are:
				1) the gadget (time machine), which is not dominant in the story;
				and 2) Aldiss's whole prose style, which is brilliant. In the
				latter regard, I should at least mention his &quot;poetry&quot;:
				Not only does he employ a great number of images, but almost
				invariably his images operate through the poetic modes of simile
				or metaphor: &quot;Its eyes gleamed with the liveliness of a
				week-dead corpse's big toe&quot;; &quot;Slowly, a squeeze of cold
				reptile blood toothpastes down one cheek&quot;; &quot;the midget
				maggot of life is dead in the creature's skull.&quot; The
				sardonicism is necessary; perhaps it is nowhere more forceful
				than the &quot;tasty mud&quot; Claude is pitched into--it's
				gallows humor here, and that is just one more factor contributing
				to the horror of the final paragraphs--read them again, they get
				even worse (which means better, in terms of the artistry). 
				</P>
<h5>&nbsp;</h5>
				<H5 align=center>3.
				&quot;The Queen Bee&quot;</H5>
<h5>&nbsp;</h5>
				<P>The
				final two stories I shall discuss are included only for their
				content, as I want to clear up a few points which I couldn't
				include in Chapter I. This is not to say that there is anything
				wrong with the writing, but it is by no means so &quot;dense&quot;
				or &quot;rich&quot; as the previous ones mentioned--that is, the
				complexity is less great, to revert to Chapter II's terms--, and
				I am far more interested in what's going on in them. 
				</P>
				<P>Randall
				Garrett's &quot;The Queen Bee&quot; appeared in the December,
				1958,  <I>Astounding</I>. An intersteller liner explodes. There
				are only seven survivors (four men and three women) who manage to
				get a lifeboat to an inhabitable planet. The title of the story
				applies to Elissa Krand, a spoiled and egotistical rich man's
				daughter. Now, the law dictates that survirors are to try to
				populate any planet they become marooned on. When one of the
				other women becomes pregnant Elissa kills her and also the third
				woman. She then sets out to play the &quot;queen bee,&quot; and
				demands service from the four men, threatening to abort any
				children they might force on her. The men are restrained from
				killing her by their desire to propagate the race, although they
				all hate her. Finally they decide to make of her a literal queen
				bee, and perform a lobotomy: &quot;One year later, the first
				child born on the planet Generatrix was a lovely baby girl, named
				Tina.&quot; 
				</P>
				<P>The
				story is dealing with the solution of a problem of the future.
				Problem: to perpetuate the race when the only available female
				refuses to cooperate. Solution: a lobotomy, leaving her placid
				and mindless but not damaging her genetically. Implications:
				Society and the Race are of paramount importance; the solution is
				a hard one, but so is the universe (cf., &quot;Poor Little
				Warrior&quot;), and if Man is to survive he must fight the
				Universe on its own terms. 
				</P>
				<P>Further,
				sex is dealt with here, and the one female who is afraid of men,
				and hence manifests the &quot;spinsterly distaste&quot;  <I>Time</I>
				reports Amis objecting to, is talked out of her stand. For the
				interested trend hound, I would suggest Sturgeon's &quot;To Marry
				Medusa&quot;  <I>(Galaxy</I>, August 1958) for one example of a
				different view of sex; not only is there a fine example of a
				nasty seduction there, but the plot hinges upon still another
				seduction's being successful. 
				</P>
				<P>&quot;The
				Queen Bee&quot; makes sense in its own terms and is well-written,
				although not brilliantly so. Aggressions and castrations and
				Oedipus complexes aside, it's a pretty good story. 
				</P>
<h5>&nbsp;</h5>
				<H5 align=center>4.
				 <I>The Puppet Masters</I></H5>
<h5>&nbsp;</h5>
				<P>Just
				as every discussion of literary theory seemingly must contain a
				reference to Aristotle (to say nothing of Freud, nowadays), every
				discussion of science fiction should probably contain a reference
				to Robert Heinlein. His forte is the delineation of a future
				society as background, as opposed to the out-and-out satires <I>of</I>
				the societies (as foregrounds) often encountered elsewhere. His
				scientific background may or may not have anything to do with it,
				but he is a great story teller. Though among science fiction fans
				you may hear Sturgeon or Clarke mentioned as &quot;best&quot;
				author instead of Heinlein, if you ask for the top few,
				invariably you will hear &quot;And of course, Heinlein.&quot;
				Instead of discussing style after a plot summary, I should like
				merely to state in advance that he is quite direct and
				un-&quot;complex.&quot; 
				</P>
				<P> <I>The
				Puppet Masters</I> is also out in Signet paperback, 1952. The
				narrator is an agent of the Section, a super-secret supra-FBI
				which is directly responsible to the President. He tells the
				history of an invasion of Earth by slug-like, football-sized
				parasitic creatures from Titan which attach themselves to hosts
				(they want humanity for their next host) and completely take over
				the hosts' minds, ultimately causing the host's death because the
				parasites are completely uninterested in the care and feeding of
				their hosts. The invasion is beaten back, leaving many dead
				humans and planetwide seminudism (so that any remaining parasites
				may be detected) in its wake. It's a good adventure story, quite
				exciting and gripping; however, the reason I mention it here is
				contained in the last two pages, when the narrator is concluding
				his history preparatory to leaving the planet with Operation
				Vengeance, a task force to wipe out the parasites on their home
				satellite, Titan. The philosophy expressed is quite prevalent as
				an underlying motif in science fiction, related, I believe, to
				the humanism so often noted. I shall quote selected passages,
				which delineate, in what one might call the rather homely prose
				of the first-person narrator, the point of view that Man must
				make his own place in the universe: 
				</P>
				<BLOCKQUOTE>This
					is for keeps and we intend to show those slugs that they made
					the mistake of tangling with the toughest, meanest, deadliest,
					most unrelenting--and ablest [!]--form of life in this section
					of space, a critter that can be killed but can't be tamed. . .
					Whether we make it or not, the human race has got to keep up its
					well-earned reputation for ferocity. The price of freedom is the
					willingness to do sudden battle, anywhere, any time, and with
					utter recklessness. If we did not learn that from the slugs,
					well--&quot;Dinosaurs, move over! We are ready to become
					extinct:&quot; . . . We are ready to tranship. I feel
					exhilarated. Puppet masters--the free men are coming to kill
					you!  <I>Death and Destruction!</I></P>
				</BLOCKQUOTE>
				<P>Science
				fiction <I>is</I> used to express philosophies, and here we see
				one which makes the happy synthesis of being both optimistic <I>and</I>
				realistic--there is hope, but success is not automatic to the
				pure of heart. The optimism is a refreshing change from the
				pessimistic sort of mainstream writing cited by Rosalie Moore in
				Chapter I; the realism is a refreshing change from the
				perennially &quot;upbeat,&quot; &quot;slick&quot; fiction. In
				short, science fiction is a field worthy of consideration from
				both entertainment-seekers and &quot;serious readers.&quot;</P>
