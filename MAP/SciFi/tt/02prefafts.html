				<h3 align=center>Prefatory
				Afterthoughts</h3>
				<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
				<P>When I
				write these afterthoughts, some eight years have elapsed since
				the rather lengthy paper to which they apply was &quot;submitted
				in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of
				Bachelor of Science.&quot; The only reason why my vanity was
				sufficiently reawakened to prompt me to turn to the old thesis
				again is rather simple: one of our secretaries asked me if I had
				any &quot;outside&quot; typing for her to do, and I suddenly
				remembered that not only had I thought once or twice in the past
				about &quot;getting the thing published,&quot; but an average of
				1.5 friends and acquaintances per year had expressed an interest
				in seeing the M.I.T. thesis that was about science fiction. So
				with a market of at least a dozen assured, I decided to go back
				to it and see what it was like. The results follow.
				</P>
				<P>With
				the exception of these notes, the paper is largely unchanged.
				Although the prose sometimes borders on scholarly parody, it
				would simply be an exercise--and a tedious one at that--to
				attempt to alter the style significantly. Besides, it's a faintly
				amusing style, and it includes several of the most outrageous
				puns I ever made; so it's probably worth preserving. And as to
				the argument, I will stick with it, by and large. That leaves
				only the question of whether to offer additional readings, of
				some of the last eight years' worth of science fiction which I
				found noteworthy. Perhaps it would be a good idea. However,
				although the exercise of altering the style would present no
				difficulties to one who has practiced the largely linguistic
				trades of teaching Freshman Composition, doing technical
				writing/editing, and programming computers in the intervening
				years, the performing of close readings is a skill which I am not
				convinced I could reacquire.
				</P>
				<P>So it
				stands largely as was--with exceptions. For example, one could
				scarcely have taught Freshman Comp for two and one half years and
				not clean up the odd comma problem or untangle the odd syntax,
				every so often. Some embarrassingly consistent spelling errors
				were also attended to along the way. And then there are the
				retractions, revisions, and desired alterations in emphasis;
				these I do here.
				</P>
				<P>Perhaps
				the major point to make about science fiction from the vantage
				point of 1968 is that popular critical misconceptions of the
				field seem to have abated a good deal since Sputnik <I> et</I>
				<I>seq</I>. sunk into the common knowledge of the critics. This
				consideration tends somewhat to diminish the &quot;need&quot; for
				a defense/explanation/ justification/plea for science fiction.
				That it does not diminish the need too greatly is illustrated by
				the fact that my old high school, which had refused classroom
				space for an after-hours course in the calculus in my day (on the
				grounds that the project was &quot;undemocratic&quot;), is now
				offering a genuine college-prep math course--on the grounds that
				we must catch up with Them technologically. No, doing the right
				thing for the wrong reason is not quite good enough.
				</P>
				<P>Then
				there are the changes I would have made to the contents had I not
				been amused by the notion of preserving my views as a college
				senior, for some sort of &quot;historical&quot; reasons. For one
				thing, in the light of later experience, I think I was far too
				kind to the so-called social sciences throughout; this bias is
				based upon having seen too much of the way in which so-called
				social scientists abuse electronic data processing, among other,
				less tangible, factors. I also feel that I was not harsh enough
				to Mr. Amis; his book came out while I was in the middle of
				writing the thesis, and I didn't really have the time to evaluate
				closely. What else? Well, I was rather surprised to see how
				upbeat I was eight years ago: humanism, optimism, and all manner
				of upbeat notions. That I am a far cry from that sort of thing
				now is perhaps best witnessed by the fact that I cannot
				understand why I apologized for the kiddy divorce court; it's a
				splendid idea. But it does remind me of the one regret I have
				over not being up to adding new readings: Robert Heinlein has
				written some absolutely superb books in the last eight years; it
				is no longer the case that &quot;and of course there's Heinlein&quot;
				is what one says after listing a few of one's favorite authors:
				there's Heinlein, and then there are the others. He still doesn't
				write &quot;pretty&quot; prose, but he's the best storyteller,
				and he tells the best stories.</P>
				<P><B>{</B>The
				one irresistible addition [8/00]: Go get the as-written (&quot;original
				uncut&quot;, &copy;1991) version of &quot;Stranger&quot; if you
				haven't already. Compare it to the as-published (1963)
				version. Before you've finished with the first page, and
				certainly by the time you finish the first chapter, you should
				realize that his prose was, in its natural state, far, far more
				attractive than we've been led to believe<B>. </B>Indeed,
				when I first performed the exercise, I threw the as-published one
				into the air and screamed, &quot;I hate copyeditors!&quot; after
				only a few paragraphs' worth of p. 1. &nbsp; I later learned that
				Heinlein had done the cutting himself, at the publisher's
				behest since they didn't want to invest in so &quot;big&quot;
				a science fiction book in the then-current state of the market,
				but having become a published author myself during the interval
				between the two publications, I still hate copyeditors. [There's
				also an as-written version of &quot;Puppet Masters&quot; available.  The
				differences between it and the as-published version are nowhere near
				so striking as is the case with &quot;Stranger&quot;, but since the book figures
				in Chapter III, it seemed worth mentioning here.]
				<B>}</B></P>
				<P>Aside
				from that, there are no particular apologies to be made. I still
				feel, my thesis advisor to the contrary notwithstanding, that a
				basically deductive approach was the only one to take in an
				undergraduate thesis. He still feels that I should have taken the
				same sort of inductive approach which he took in his Ph.D.
				dissertation on Restoration Comedy, but that was, after all, for
				the doctorate--and from Harvard. To me, 25-28,000 words is more
				than one really should say for a mere Bachelor's degree.
				</P>
				<P>To
				conclude these afterthoughts as I began the thesis, with Theodore
				Sturgeon. There is attributed to him a sublime natural law, known
				as Sturgeon's Law, of course. When told that 90% of science
				fiction is crap, he replied, &quot;Of course it is. 90% of
				<I>everything</I> is crap.&quot; Perhaps apocryphal, but the best
				and onlie true conclusion to the following.
