## More than Pulp(?): Science Fiction and the Problem of Literary Merit


The ?First? ?Second? Thesis on SciFi as LitCrit.

MIT graciously returned to M.A.P., in 2003, copyright to M.A.P.'s 1960 Bachelor's Thesis.

* [Same as HTML pages](./tt/) - recommended, to see the retrospective commentary.
* anecdotes related thereto (coming?)

This was for 35 years presumed to be the first academic thesis on SciFi as LitCrit, but no, writer and *bonefide* academic James E Gunn (1923-2020) did his 1951 M.A. thesis first. 
(Had the Internet been available in 1960, a literature search would have found it, or at least the 1958 reference to it.) 
MAP's is likely still the earliest *Bachelors* Thesis or *MIT* thesis, and it centers **Literary Merit** right in the title.
