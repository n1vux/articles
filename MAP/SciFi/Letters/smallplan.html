<section><P class="subhead">The Newest Profession</P>
<P class="body">
As
with most good Plans, the starting point is the recognition of a
misnomer: For although other students of Trickydicktion appear to
have overlooked it, Our Millstone&rsquo;s <a href="https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/a+millstone+around+neck">Our Millstone</a>,
	<a href="#millstone" name="millstone" class="footnote" /></a><span class="footnote">A pun on Richard <U>Millhouse</U> Nixon and the idiom &quot;a millstone round the neck&quot;. 
		RMN was also known as "Tricky Dick" based in part on his penchant for campaign dirty tricks, which led to the Watergate impeachment crisis; so MAP puns on RMN's diction with a nonce portmanteau.</span>
reference to there being
nothing inherently wrong with &ldquo;the profession of politics&rdquo;
the other month <a href="#month" name="month" class="footnote" /></a><span class="footnote">"other month" presumably meaning recently in 1973 so spring or early summer?</span>
falls well below even his notions in re the rights of
the unborn. Indeed, the mere suggestion that such a thing as a
profession of politics exists ranks right down there in the
Trickydicktionary with the never-to-be-sufficiently-scorned &ldquo;greatest
thing since the Creation&rdquo; farrago. (After all, to professed
Christians there was, one imagines, at least one intervening event of
some considerable greatness between Adam and Eve and Armstrong and
Aldrin. To those of us who are fond of space travel, an appropriate
hyperbole might be &ldquo;the greatest thing since the Invention of
the Wheel&rdquo; or somesuch; but, since the Creation?!?...)<a href="#slicdedbread" name="slicedbread" class="footnote" /></a><span class="footnote">It was Armstrong and Aldrin's moon-landing in 1969 that newly inaugurated 
	President RMN risked hubris by describing thus. 
	And we should note that Sliced Bread was the greatest thing since Betty White. &mdash; Ed.</span>
</P>
<P class="body">
The
refutation of the politics-as-profession notion is straightforward,
but of some interest nonetheless. Fundamentally, the trick of diction
is very simple: Our Millstone has snuck in still another sports
metaphor. It is indeed the case that in sports, the &ldquo;professional&rdquo;
athletes are those who get overtly paid for it; the &ldquo;amateur&rdquo;
athletes, of course, are not supposed to get paid at all. So one can
certainly manage to posit a professional politician as one who gets
paid for taking part in politics. Unfortunately, the phrase was not
used in a context which would support such an interpretation. Rather,
in dedicating the Everett P. Dirksen Memorial Whatever, the attempt
was being made to suggest that politics is a profession in the old
sense &mdash; a &ldquo;learned profession;&rdquo; a field for which one is
specifically educated over a longish period of time; or at least a
way of making a living for which one has had considerable special
training.</P>
<P class="body">
Yet
surely it is clear that none of the above pertains to the trade of
officeseeking. Neither M.I.T. nor Harvard has a major in &ldquo;Politics&rdquo; 
(and what &ldquo;Political Science&rdquo; means is obscure &mdash; 
probably just an attempt
at the orderly study of politics, or the like; at any rate, certainly
not the science of being a politician).
<a href="#polysci" name="polysci" class="footnote"></a><span class="footnote">This is careful wording.
	 In 2021, both Harvard College and MIT have a &quot;Political Science&quot major; but not &quot;Politics&quot; <i>per se</i>.
	 We may infer that MAP's point is that the Poli.Sci. major and academic career is the Study and Theory of Politicians and Political Systems 
	 (and preparation of professors of same),
	 not the professional preparation of politicians, 
	 on which he would appear to be on sound ground.</span>
Indeed, nowadays if there
were a specific academic training program for <!-- ofticeseekers looks like an OCR faux ligature, not a humo[u]rous nonceword --> 
officeseekers it would
doubtless turn out to be under the aegis of the Theater Arts
Department.</P>
<P class="body">
What
preparations, then, <U>do</U> officeseekers make? That is, campaign
contribution gathering aside, how do officeseekers prepare themselves
for doing officeseeking/holding for a living? Statistically, the
answer is resounding: they go to law school first, then try to set up
shop as law-makers. Even those of us who are rightfully distrustful
of Statistics (including not only cigarette smokers, but also many
students of the philosphy of science who have worried <span style="font-size: larger;">a</span>
bit about causality) find
it hard to overlook how large the proportion is. <U>Most people who
make their living seeking political office have only prepared for
such a role by getting a law degree</U>. So &ldquo;professionalism&rdquo;
begins to look like the next-to-last refuge of the scoundrel.</P>
<P class="body">Is that good?</P>
</section>
<section><P class="subhead">Aid From Socrates</P>

<P class="body">
Of
course, questions about Politics and the Good always make one think
about Socrates &mdash; or, anyway, Plato. (No, not the silly old <U>Republic</U>.
How could you trust anybody who bans poets, especially when he should
be counted as a poet himself. It&rsquo;s almost as bad as a poem the
meaning of which is that a poem shouldn&rsquo;t have meaning.
Recursively unbearable, as the mathematicians say. Besides, this
business about training in not getting caught is rather weird itself.
All too reminiscent of Reasoner&rsquo;s <a href="#reasoner" name="reasoner" class="footnote"><span class="footnote">Presumably Harry Reasoner (1923-1991), TV journalist, co-founder of <i>60 Minutes</i>. 
 gloss on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ehrlichman">Ehrlichmonster</a>: 
&ldquo;You can do whatever you can get away with, so long as you
don&rsquo;t take a drink first.&rdquo;  Fortunately, though, there <U>is</U>
a difference between the <U>Republic</U> and the Republicans: one of
them believes in sex.)  Actually, the Greek Connection comes clear
when you think about the Good, Politics, and ... 
lawyers.</P>
<P class="body">
Remember
what Socrates is supposed to have said about the Sophists? He used to
be one, but he got tired of making &ldquo;the Worse appear the Better
Cause&rdquo; for a living. Who were the Sophists, by the way?
Why, they were the law schools of the day, that&rsquo;s who. And what
are lawyers? The practicing Sophists of this day, that&rsquo;s who.
For what do they do for a living but make the worse appear the better
cause?</P>
<P class="body">
&ldquo;Have
you stopped beating your wife? answer yes or no,&rdquo; is a classic,
of course. But the public is by and large onto that one. Consider a
couple of more contemporary examples: Consider the lawyer who is
willing to affect ignorance of the definitions of embezzlement and of
hearsay evidence in order to make an unfriendly-to-his-cause witness
look bad in the eyes of the audience/jury. But do embezzlers leave
I.O.U.'s? Is hearsay not explicitly permitted by Committee Rule 16?
(Or was it 13?) To borrow the only felicitous locution ever known to
have been employed by Our Millstone,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT15cqM78R8">&ldquo;Poppycock!&rdquo;</a></P>
<P class="body">
Yet
that&rsquo;s what lawyers do for a living &mdash;
full-time if they&rsquo;re
not officeholders, and at least part-time if they are. They make, if
they can, the Worse appear to be the Better Cause. Perhaps, then, the
only legislative relief we stand in need of is the banning of lawyers
from politics. 
	<a href="#lawyers" name="lawyers" class="footnote" /></a><span class="footnote">
		One can indeed argue it's a <i>conflict of interest</i> for lawyers to legislate. 
		<br />
		A mutual friend of MAP's and ours (Esq., RIP) hastened to point out that it's a comic fool character in Shakespeare who suggests Lawyers should be the first to the wall. 
		</span>
(The Social Compact wasn't really formed to keep
lawyers off the streets, no matter how much to the contrary
appearances seem today.) It <U>is</U> tempting, if only on conflict
of interest/restraint of trade/antitrust grounds. After all, if the
laws are promulgated by the lawyers, how can the result possibly be
other than to create more business for more lawyers? (This might also
help to explain The Master&rsquo;s observation that laws are like
cobwebs, which may catch small flies, but let wasps [!] and hornets
break through.)<a href="#swift2" name="swift2" class="footnote" /></a><span class="footnote">
		Jonathan Swift, again, Master of Swiftian satire.
		<br /> 
		The [!] notes the double-meaning acquired by wasp=W.A.S.P. in the centuries since Swift, that coincidentally works quite well here.
		Does that make MAP the <i>Pierre Mendard</i> to Swift's Cervante, in that the re-telling has greater ironic depth? &mdash; - Ed.</span> 
 It&rsquo;s tempting, but is it enough?</P>
<P class="subhead">Hayes's Law</P>
<P class="body">
However
tempting the thought of being Socratic by banning lawyers from our
Republic, the solution would be inadequate. It would merely open the
doors wide to invasion by officeseekers from some other realm of
post-graduate-trained con-men &mdash;
&ldquo;social scientists&rdquo;
perhaps. No, a satisfactory solution to the reform of the political
process must have its roots in a recognition of the motivations of
officeseekers. On this score, we may look to a widely-held law of
nature attributed to Professor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Hayes#Ohio_State">Woodrow Hayes</a> of Ohio State
University. 
The formulation of Hayes&rsquo;s Law goes something like
this:</P>
<blockquote>
<U>There are only three things which can happen when you throw
a forward pass,
<br />
 and two of them are bad.</U>
</blockquote>

<P class="body">
(If
any in this day and age have managed to remain ignorant of the
technical details of the Greater American Pastime, it should be
pointed out that the three things are incompletion, interception, and
completion. From the perspective of the team which attempted the
pass, only completion is desirable. No morals will be drawn, but we
should be clear on our technical premises when attempting to apply a
law of nature from another discipline into our own.)</P>
<P class="body">
The
application to politics borders on the obvious. Let us restate the
law, then consider it in more detail:</P>
<blockquote>
<U>There are only three things which can motivate a person to seek political
office, <br /> 
and two of them are bad.</U>
</blockquote>
<P class="body">
The
first category of political motivation is the one which at least
feels like the most common. Whether it be termed greed, power-hunger,
avarice, cupidity, corruption, or what-have-you, Category I political
motivation has to do with what the officeseeker will get out of the
office sought. All the sub-headings in this category have been dealt
with at great length by others; we need only note it here and pass
on, without even arguing about the quantification.</P>
<P class="body">
The
second category of political motivation is the one which at least
feels like the most treacherous. Whether it be termed
sanctimoniousness, absolutism, legislation of morality, forced
proselytizing, or what-have-you, Category II politcal motivation has
to do with the officeseeker&rsquo;s conviction that he knows what is
Right and on gaining office will be able to impose that view on the
constituency. Again, this category has been dealt with elsewhere; we
need not even argue about the qualification &mdash;
Category II is also bad,
and may be worse.</P>
<P class="body">
It
is only in the third category of political motivation that hope may
be found, for Category III political motivation has to do with
seeking office in order to prevent the office&rsquo;s being occupied
by a number of either Category I or Category II. (After all, from the
perspective of the defensive team, interception <U>is</U> the best
result <I>....)</I></P>
<P class="body">
And
that&rsquo;s all there are. There aren&rsquo;t any more. Even in
non-elective political structures (saving perhaps the hereditary),
you&rsquo;re either after an office for what you can get out of it,
for what you can get into with it, or because your social conscience
prompts you to deny the office to somebody less qualified and/or
worse motivated.</P>
<P class="subhead">How Bad Is It?</P>

<P class="body">
Before
turning to a consideration of methods for increasing the proportion
of Category III types in elective offices, we should take pause to
consider how bad the current situation really is. Perhaps only a few
bandaids are needed <I>...
</I>or perhaps even
amputation at the neck won&rsquo;t suffice.</SPAN></P>
<P class="body">
Taking
one consideration with another, it&rsquo;s pretty bad. There&rsquo;s
no need &mdash; other
than masochism &mdash;  to
rehearse the recently-exposed evidence in regard to &ldquo;campaign
law&rdquo; abuses, for example. After all, that they are
&ldquo;campaigning&rdquo; at all makes most candidates suspect by
appeal to Hayes&rsquo;s Law as reformulated for politics. The very
term &ldquo;campaigning&rdquo; gives the show away.</P>
<P class="body">
A
<U>military</U> campaign is a familiar phrase, but is a political
campaign also an all-out battle between deadly enemies? Again, there
is considerable contemporary evidence that many &ldquo;in high
position&rdquo; think it so. But should it be? Well, it really ought
to go without saying that if you treat an election as a civil war you
can scarcely expect to have any real state of the consent of the
governed after you&rsquo;ve defeated the enemy. And yet we have heard
a former Attorney General publicly proclaim with surly pride that he
himself had violated the law, by vitholding knowledge of a crime <I>...
</I>because he was afraid
that his candidate might lose the election/war.</P>
<P class="body">
It
is not surprising that the trial-by-combat view of politics leads to
a view of the world wherein the President is distinguishable from a
King only in that his tenure is limited by the Constitution. At the
rate the Constitution is being ignored of late, even that limitation
begins to feel like fairly feeble comfort. <U>Forty</U> more years of
Richard the Lyin&rsquo; Heart, anyone? Even a Philosopher King <i>a la</i>
Plato would have its drawbacks (especially to those of us who have
looked closely at philosophers &mdash; Philosophies), but the American
Term Monarchy view simply boggles the stomach.</P>
<P class="body">
Indeed,
even the Monarchial analogy might not go far enough. So much has been
said recently about &ldquo;the Presidency&rdquo; and &ldquo;the
Highest Office&rdquo; in such tones
and terms of adulation for the abstraction (&ldquo;My President &mdash;
may he always be Right, but My President Right or Wrong&rdquo; is
just around the corner),<a href="#corner" name="corner" class="footnote" ></a><span class="footnote">This reformulation 
		from "<em>My Country</em> ... " to "<em>My President</em> ..." 
		being "<em>just around the corner</em>" 
		is eerily prescient in retrospect from 2021. &mdash; Ed.</span>
that one is led to wonder if mere Kingship
might not be a demotion. When a President complains that he cannot
govern when people doubt his word, one is even led to wonder whether
the Presidency might not be widely viewed as, say ... Our Word made
Flesh? The thought should be obscene even to those of us who are not
professed Christians, but there it is: Rather than viewing the
President as the Head of the Executive Branch (who is not, it should
be remarked, Constitutionally expected to &ldquo;govern&rdquo; at all
&mdash; merely to be the Chief Execu&shy;tive), large segments of
the population seem to join the encumbered incumbent in viewing the
President as ... God.</P>
<P class="body">
Curiously
enough, going hand-in-hand &mdash; or tongue-in-mouth&mdash; with such naive
theophilia is what might felicitously be called naive politicophobia.
That is, if you believe in Polls, you don&rsquo;t believe in Pols.
There&rsquo;s scarcely a need to adduce evidence here; after all,
&ldquo;everybody&rdquo; &ldquo;knows&rdquo; &ldquo;all&rdquo;
politicians are &ldquo;crooks&rdquo;. The popular conception, then,
is that Category I motivations &mdash;especially certain of the sub-heads
&mdash; are totally dominant in those who voluntarily enter the political
&ldquo;arena&rdquo;. On this assumption, some even profess to be
bored with all the scandals. But as George Giles tells us Reginald
Hector told him, &ldquo;&lsquo;the scandal-thing&rsquo; was no light
matter when the reputation of leaders was at stake (&lsquo;since men
won&rsquo;t die for a fellow they don&rsquo;t respect&rsquo;).&rdquo;
In other words, despite Shaw&rsquo;s Maxim that &ldquo;Democracy
substitutes election by the incompetent many for appointment by the
corrupt few,&rdquo; we seem to be getting the worst of both
world-views these days.</P>
<P class="body">
Surprisingly
perhaps, the new strategy of attempting to justify the sins of the
current Administration by pointing at the (real or imagined) sins of
past Administrations panders to the politicophobic position. (The
strategy, by the way, is not without its own curiosity value: do
2,000 wrongs make a right?) Indeed, there&rsquo;s a certain
attractiveness to the position &mdash; the image of the 
system
of checks and balances&rsquo; resolving itself into a system of bank
drafts and scales (for weighing stacks of currency) is difficult to
repress. But the <i>expandio ad absurdum</i> comes too soon, for this sort
of thinking all too easily leads to the fantastic notion that the
winner of a popularity contest (or, more often than not, the loser of
an unpopularity contest) really does have some sort of &ldquo;mandate&rdquo;
for his policies. Now <U>that's</U> a frightening prospect ... far
more so even than that the President/Monarch/God should actually be
proven to have been screwing mortals. (At least there are Classical
precedents for the latter.)</P>
<P class="body">
On
balance, then, perhaps a people really does get the government it
deserves and that&rsquo;s all there is to it. Yet it would be nice if
we could find a way at least to diminish the necessity for simply
shrugging and saying that all politicians are ... whatevers.
Remember, if we could only get more Category IlI-motivated types into
office, we&rsquo;d clearly be better off. At present, though, the
public attitude depicted as &ldquo;apathetic&rdquo; and/or &ldquo;cynical&rdquo;
by both the mass media and the politicians does not seem to be a
wholly inappropriate response to the circumstances which confront the
public. What price idealism, after all, when even the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap_Box_Derby#1973_Scandal">Soap Box Derby</a>
is &ldquo;won&rdquo; by cheating ...?</P>

<P class="body">It <U>is</U> that bad.</P>
</section>
<section><P class="subhead">An Essay On &ldquo;Cynicism&rdquo;</P>

<P class="body">
Between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_F._Buckley_Jr.">Bull Buckley</a>, 
<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hortatory">Hortatery</a> 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Cosell">Howard Cosell</a>, 
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiro_Agnew">Vice President Corkscrew</a>
(whose-name-was-a-household-word), words are getting a bad name in
this country. If we can save just one word, though, not only can we
partially refute my friend Tom who keeps saying that it&rsquo;s a
dead language, but we can also forestall the sort of slurs with which
it is to be anticipated that the forthcoming plan will be met. The
word, of course, is &ldquo;cynicism&rdquo;.</P>

<P class="body">
Now, who were the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynicism_(philosophy)">Cynics</a>? Well, sometime around the period when the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophist">Sophists</a> were hustling the first law schools, the Cynics were more
concerned with &ldquo;virtue&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Good&rdquo;; they
were going around saying &ldquo;I doubt it&rdquo; about the worth of
most material things. (Presumably, about the Sophists most of all.) 
In short, they may be thought of as an early school of sceptical
philosophers. &ldquo;Scepticism&rdquo; &mdash; now that doesn&rsquo;t
sound nearly so bad as &ldquo;cynicism&rdquo;, does it?  Especially
when you realize that good old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogenes#/media/File:Diogenes_looking_for_a_man_-_attributed_to_JHW_Tischbein.jpg">Diogenes</a> was a Cynic. Go one step
further and observe that the Cynics were as American as the Man From
Missouri who insists on being shown, and we see just what sort of
havoc Trickydicktion can wreak on our sensibilities.... So, next time
a politician or a pundit calls you a cynic, thank him for the
compliment and proceed about your business of doubting the pious lies
and seeking the nude truth. (And if you&rsquo;re worried that the
Supreme Court&rsquo;ll getchya for messing around with nudies, well
... surely nobody would find obscene a bumper sticker which says
&ldquo;Fornicate the Supreme Court&rdquo;.) 
</P>

<section><P class="subhead">The Answer</P>

<P class="body">
Alright,
we&rsquo;ve seen that too many politicians are unqualified for
office; that the legal profession is the intellectual counterpart of
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oldest_profession_(phrase)">&ldquo;oldest profession&rdquo;</a>; that most officeseekers are in
the racket for base reasons; that the contempt of the governed is
more prevalent than the consent of the governed; that &ldquo;water
gate&rdquo; is just another way of spelling &ldquo;damn&rdquo;; and
that cynicism is good for you. The question is, &ldquo;Can this
Society be saved?&rdquo; What&rsquo;s the Answer?</P>

<P class="body">
Again,
there&rsquo;s a Classical Connection; this time it&rsquo;s Reman.
Remember Cincinatus? He&rsquo;s the one who, as you can verify in
your dictionary, was a &ldquo;Roman patriot. He was called from his
farm to be dictator in 458 and 439 B.C. Each time he resigned his
dictatorship and returned to his farm when the enemy was defeated.&rdquo;
And that doesn&rsquo;t mean he spent all his time at Campus Davidus
after slaying St. George with a poisonous insect on the back. He
came, he did what he had to, he went home. It may sound as
un-American as eating frogs&rsquo; legs to us XXth century types, but
that&rsquo;s what he did. Ge ahead, look it up; you might also happen
to learn a few new words on the way, which is always salutary. (But
if you want to check up on me on the Cynics, unless you've got a very
good one you'd better eschew your dictionary and try Russell's
<U>History of</U> <U>Western Philosophy</U>; my dictionary, anyway,
has the Cynics confused with the Stoics &mdash;who also were scarcely Bad
guys.)  
</P>

<P class="body">
Clearly,
if there were a patron saint of Category III motivation for
officeseeking it would be Cincinatus. And the Question reduces itself
to the more managable form, &ldquo;Can we get more
Cincinatus/Categery III people into the government?&rdquo; I think we
can &mdash; rather easily, in fact. (This is where the Small Plan
comes in. Ready?)</P>

<blockquote>
<U>To assure a vast improvement in the character of officeseekers <br />
it is necessary merely to choose candidates for office by lot</U>.
</blockquote>

<P class="body">
Some
explication is perhaps in order, but that&rsquo;s the kernel:
eliminate the sort of people who volunteer for office and we
automatically improve our chances of winding up with a good officer.</P>
<P class="body">
Of
course, the execution is neither so simple nor so elegant as the
conception. But it needn&rsquo;t be terribly complicated. For any
office, choose, say, twelve (a good number in many mythologies)
constituents&rsquo; names at random. As discussed below, certain
minimal restrictions might be placed on the name pool. If fewer than
six are able to stand for office for reasons of health, keep picking
until you have at least six candidates. Then allow them a week to
come up with a statement of 200-500 words about themselves (200
minimum to show they know some words; 500 maximum to show they can be
approximately concise); age and education data don&rsquo;t count
against the word limit; military service data do, but may not be used
to reach the minimum count. At the expense of the governmental entity
in question, distribute copies of the statements to all the
constituents (and require them to be posted in the polling places
just in case). Wait two weeks, then vote. Most votes &ldquo;wins&rdquo;
&mdash; or, in any event, the recipient serves the term in the
office in question.</P>

Some
embellishments might be useful. If we feel that we can&rsquo;t live
without the over-praised-at-any-price Two Party System (for which, by
the way, I can find no basis in my copy of the Constitution), any
recognized Party might be entitled to submit a list of no more than
two dozen questions to the candidates &mdash; answerable by &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a bachelor and have not started
beating my wife.&rdquo; A tabulation of the answers would accompany
the candidates' statements, along with a list of the questions by
Party (but no Approved Answers are permitted). Further, no Party may
aid in the preparation of any candidate&rsquo;s statement. (Recall
that Parties have been rightly called the madness of the many for the
profit of a few.) Matter of fact, it might be worth bringing back the
death penalty for <U>anyone</U> who helps a candidate write the
required statement. (If there&rsquo;s anything worse than a lawyer,
it&rsquo;s an adman.)</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium; line-height: 150%">
Speaking
of limitations, it might be worthwhile to consider a limited name
pool for executive offices &mdash; say, pick from the chief executive
officers of the 100 (1,000 in National elections) largest businesses
in the constituency. At least that way a Chief Exective might know
<U>something</U> about being a chief executive. On the other hand,
there&rsquo;s a certain charm to the old myth that anyone
(native-born and over 35) can become President (I almost said &ldquo;grow
up to be President,&rdquo; but, again, nothing in the Constitution
says the President must be grown up), so perhaps we should except
Federal executive positions from the restricted name pool notion.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium; line-height: 150%">
Another
tempting idea is to make Legislatures approximate better their
theoretical representative nature by assuring that a fraction of the
seats be at-large, with the candidates drawn from specific name pools
&mdash; like scientists (&quot;hard&quot; and &ldquo;soft&rdquo; are, of
course, separate), engineers (including, for kindness's sake,
computer programmers), teachers, &ldquo;housewives,&rdquo;
unemployed, and, it we want to be excessively charitable, maybe even
lawyers.</P>
</section>
<section><P class="subhead">The Advantages</P>

<P class="body">
Leaving
embellishments aside &mdash; after all, there has to be something to
debate when the Constitutional Amendment comes up &mdash; let&rsquo;s turn
to the advantages of choosing candidates by lot. The Pik-a-Pol Plan
(just to forestall the Madison Avenue types making a fortune on it, I
might as well get the name copyright now) would clearly fulfill the
basic goal of representative government better than the current
silliness does. The People would certainly get the government they
deserve. (It we don&rsquo;t get a significantly larger number of
Category III motivation types, it&rsquo;s only because the bad guys
vastly outnumber the good in the native population as well as amongst
those willing to &ldquo;run&rdquo; for office.) (And isn&rsquo;t it
interesting that in English English they &ldquo;stand&rdquo; for
office rather than &ldquo;run&rdquo;?) It&rsquo;s clearly pure
Participatory Democracy. We&rsquo;d certainly put to the test all the
rhetoric flying around these days about the &ldquo;special genius of
the American People&rdquo; .... Finally, even if the draw were
rigged, we&rsquo;d still be better off than we are now, because at
least with six to twelve candidates per office we&rsquo;d have some
chance ot finding someone to vote <U>for</U> instead of merely voting
against the one we like less or have been convinced to fear more.</P>


<P class="body">
Two
rather subtle advantages deserve separate mention: In the first
place, it has finally become popular to decry the position of both
women and so-called ethnic-minorities vis a vis the Establishment.
Well, it surely doesn&rsquo;t take a statistician to tell what would
happen if candidates for office were drawn from the whole population
instead of from the boys in the back room. In the second place,
there&rsquo;s our old reliable International Communist Conspiracy.
Even if Our Millstone, 
has lost the faith (and has even managed to go
one up on Stalin Himself by collectivizing <U>our</U> farms through
the simple expedient of freezing the smallholders out of existence &mdash;
far more statesmanlike than starving or shooting 14,000,000 kulaks to
death), there are still those who would like to see Us triumph over
Them. Pik-a-Pol can do it. For if the great appeal of the I.C.C. is
that it holds out the premise of a &ldquo;Dictatorship of the
Proletariat&rdquo; and has won over around half the world with it,
how much better will we do with a real live Government of the
Proletariat?</P>

<P class="body">
Even
the one possible disadvantage of Pik-a-Pol turns out to be an
advantage when viewed aright. The objection might be raised that
randomly-chosen candidates may not be qualified for the particular
offices their names were matched with. Now, the &ldquo;obvious&rdquo;
rejoinder would be to point out that there&rsquo;s no guarantee that
candidates are qualified under the present system either. A more
telling answer is that they&rsquo;d be just as qualified for serving
in office as jury members are to serve on juries under the current
selection techniques. (Maybe even more so, as you probably have to be
brighter to be able to resist the blandishments of a trial lawyer
than to be able to decide that if A wants $10 f or each street sign
and B wants $5 for each sign of like quality, you should buy from B
if you&rsquo;re buying street signs.</P>
<P class="body">
One
vexing question remains: Should there be any limitations placed on
the name pools because of past indiscretions? That is, should
convicted felons, mental defectives (in the medical sense), and
lawyers be prohibited? Good arguments can be raised on both sides.
When all is said and done, though, I suspect that the best resolution
of this issue is to limit the name pool no more and no less than you
limit the franchise. For although it was a bit questionable in the
context of a Supreme Court appointment, when it comes to holding
elective office &mdash; as a member of the United States Senate himself
has said it &mdash; even the mediocre deserve representation. (You might,
by the by, want to look up &ldquo;mediocrity&rdquo; sometime;
Trickydicktion has even given <U>it</U> a bad name....) Besides, if
any idiot can vote it seems only fair that any idiot can hold office.</P>

<P class="body">
The
final advantage is rather visionary. However, it does occur to me
that the Pik-a-Pol principle when proven in practice might even be
extended beyond the realm of elective office. Is it too idealistic
and fanciful to consider the possibility of even picking by lot
members of ... the Civil Service? I know it's awfully radical to
contemplate a reform of Holy Mother Bureaucracy.  After all,
officeseekers and officeholders may come and go whether
representative or not, but Bureaucrats are eternal. Well, it&rsquo;s
only an afterthought, and I suppose I <U>am</U> a dreamer &mdash; but,
someday, somehow, to see this land of ours, of yours and mine &mdash; and
even Theirs, I suppose &mdash; come to that blessed point when Their motto
no longer need be ... &ldquo;The Civil Service Isn&rsquo;t&rdquo;</P>

<P class="subhead">Things to Ignore</P>

<P class="body">
Certain
traditionalists will doubltless express displeasure at so neat a
solution as Pik-a-Pol. Prompted by their vested interests, they will
speak of the possibility of &ldquo;cleaning up the current system&rdquo;
and offer Plans of their own.</P>

<P class="body">
For
example, it might be suggested that the nominating process be opened
up by such expedients as barring all campaign contributions; even
barring all campaign advertising all the way down to, and including,
campaign buttons. Or it might be attempted to improve the character
of participants in the electoral process through such ploys as tight
limits on the number of terms a legislator may serve, eliminating the
all-too-familiar stepping-stone tactics of seekers of local office by
enforcing &ldquo;sabbaticals&rdquo; of several years between the
holding of one office and another, or making perjury by a politician
a capital crime (it&rsquo;s already <U>the</U> Capitol crime). Others
will claim that the Chief Executive&rsquo;s position would not be
subject to abuse if there were no re-election to the Presidency, or
if White House &ldquo;staff&rdquo; positions were replaced by &ldquo;line&rdquo;
positions (either directly elected or at least confirmable by
Congress) so as to have clear channels of responsibility. Still
others will assert that lifetime judicial appointments and &ldquo;career&rdquo;
civil servants should be eliminated in the interests of
responsiveness to public needs. Or those who are overly concerned
with economics might raise the idea that the public can scarcely
expect a fair shake in a setup where individuals&rsquo; incomes are
subject to higher tax rates than are corporations'. It is even
faintly possible that some benighted souls might urge public semantic
analysis of all political speeches.</P>

<P class="body">
Naturally,
all these schemes must be ignored. They are far too complicated; they
treat the symptoms rather than the disease; and the time we wasted
trying them out would just delay the implementation of the obviously
superior Pik-a-Pol Plan. No, only one possible other Plan can even
remotely be considered:</P>
</section>
<section><P class="subhead">An Acceptable Alternative</P>

<P class="body">
In
the unlikely event any reader finds this Small Plan at all
over-complicated, there <U>is</U> an even simpler solution: Despite
the drawback that it would generate more work for the lawyers, we
<U>could</U> just pass a
Constitutional Amendment making campaign promises legally binding
....</P>
