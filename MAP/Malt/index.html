<p>Mike was a Scotch blogger before there was a Web on which have WebLogs — by the medium of netmail(<em>as they called it when they were inventing it</em>, as he'd have said) and file transfer sharing of text files.</p>
<p>His quest, called &quot;Primary Research Area&quot;, was to find another bottle of the semi-mythical A&amp;N MOHM Glen Grant 14, and secondarily, to determine what was the second-best single-malt after that, which resulted in The Research Notes.</p>

<p>The (D)ARPAnet/MILnet/DDN networking folks had periodic meetings at NATO regarding the digitization of allies. Mike regularly stopped off in Scotland on the way home from Brussels or Malvern.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was asked to give a talk at Edinburgh University, since I was going to be in the neighborhood to do field work in my real area of research interest, what we call single malt Scotch and what they call malt whisky. Having mentioned why I was around at the start of the talk, I was delighted to be invited to take a dram afterwards by a rather seniorlooking gent, up in his office, which turned out to be quite a posh one, making me assume he was quite senior.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Since he had an appointment in a few minutes and I was supposed to go off to the pub with my local cohorts, we didn't even take time to sit, just exchanged a few pleasantries about our respective books and a thought or two about the particular malt whisky he'd happened to have in his desk. At the pub, I mentioned the incident to the gang and was informed that my host had been their new Professor of Computer Science, which, I might not now, was a relatively more distinguished rank there than in the States.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I replied that I had known that, but was pleased with the information anyway since it would make the event all the more memorable. Then I added that I hadjust realized I'd have had to remember it forever anyway, since it was, after all, the first talk I'd ever given that had received a standing libation.</p>
