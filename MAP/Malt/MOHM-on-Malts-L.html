While I do think it's a good game, I'm finding it very hard to play
because I discovered that I actually have a third bottle of the
&quot;real&quot; <b>12 y.o. Lagavulin</b> in the hoard after all, so I know what I'd
WANT to bring.  (For that matter, if I hadn't found the third I'dve
been inclined to say I'd want the two I knew of and a magnum of
Maalox.)  But since they're not on the market any more and
presumably nobody else could get them for their islands it doesn't
seem fair to nominate them, any more than it makes any sense to
wish for the even longer-gone, but still more fondly remembered <b>Glen
Grant &quot;Magnificent Old Highland Malt&quot;.</b>
 
Also, having slightly misremembered the orignal framing of the
questions, I assumed the &quot;readily available&quot; constraint meant I
couldn't opt for an <b>Adelphi Ardbeg</b>, an <b>Adelphi Springbank</b>, and a who
knows/cares for the third if the Lagvulin were out on the grounds
that there seemed to be a faint implication the choices should at
least in principle be available to others, though since I started
drafting this I do see that Brother Yen managed to save and was
good enough to reproduce the originals, which don't seem to limit the
first round of choices after all -- and he happens to favor the
Ardbeg too, I note with no real surprise -- so I guess I could go
with those two for part one.  And I wonder if the costs mightn't rule
out a third anyway, especially since I'm having trouble thinking of a
third in their league....  (Come to think of it, though, a good third
would be the <b>SMWS 39.7 </b>if it were still available, or if the
experiment had been successfully repeated since; it was a <b>Linkwood</b>
that had been aged 12 years in a fino cask and two years in an
oloroso cask, and when I mistakenly opened my hoarded bottle of it
the other month, thinking it was the already open <b>SMWS Ardbeg</b> [if
anybody can suggest why in the world I would have wrapped masking
tape around the cap of an unopened bottle, don't bore the List/Group
and/or embarrass me in &quot;public&quot; but do please tell me off-List], I
realized it was even better than I'd remembered it and indeed, to my
tastes, of course, rather extraordinary.)
 
It was, however, the three readily available ones ones that gave me
the most trouble.  After a certain amount of soul-searching I
suppose I'd go for an <b>18 y.o. Macallan</b> because it comes closest to
the <b>MOHM</b>, and the <b>G&amp;M Port Ellen</b> because it comes closest to The
<b>Lagavulin</b>.  I take the spirit of the game [NPI] to come close to
ruling out two of one and one of the other (and I have a hard time
deciding which I'd double up on anyway), though, so that leaves me
with one more choice to make but it's not an easy one:  A sense of
&quot;variety&quot; militates for either the 15 y.o. Glenfarclas that the &quot;man
on the street&quot; would want on the one hand or perhaps the 21 y.o.
Springbank that fooled me in the blind tasting in August on the
other, but neither really seems to be quite the right choice: they
strike me as ah's, but not ooh's, if that communicates.  Deciding the
gastroenterologist would tell me even two is/are too many is a
copout.  Going for the '65 Mac and the '70 Mac as counting as
different is a quibble, even though there is an unopened '65 in the
hoard as well as a couple or four of the '70s.  (There are a couple
of the Port Ellens, too, but if I were to double up I'd go with the
Mac because it seems to me to come closer to its extinct nonpareil
parallel than the P.E. does to its.)   So....  I dunno.  How about a
Glenfiddich, to help me appreciate the other two the more, and in
hono[u]r of its having been the one that got me &quot;into&quot; the &quot;single
malts&quot; in the first place?
 
Since this has gone on long enough even for my tastes, I do feel
justified in not agonizing further and having a go at the cost-
limited question -- though I say that more for my own relief than
anybody else's, of course....  (And I'll also forego musing on the fact
that I seem to have more of a weakness for caskstrengths than I'd
realized, per the revised part one choices, but wouldn't want to deny
Felix the satisfaction of seeing me at least take note of it in
&quot;public&quot;.)

&gt;<i>
</I>[...] Although one might claim that these collections merely represent
personal choices, choices that were sometimes made almost by accident (e.g.
in cases where only one bottling was available), I claim that these bottles
tacitly represent whisky in general and that each bottle represents its
distillery.  What other reason is there for viewing variety as a desirable
trait for a collection?
&lt;
 
Always answer rhetorical questions, I almost always say.  Especially
when the answers are instructive.
 
There are, I'd suggest, several other reasons than representation for
&quot;variety&quot;.  Least creditably, probably, but most common, perhaps, is
&quot;Just showin' off.&quot;  None of us, presumably, but there are certainly
some in the world who acquire for the sake of acquisition -- or even
acquisitiveness.  (Well, perhaps even less creditable is the position
that whisky tastes better than etchings: Have some 'morangie, m'dear....)
 
More creditably, there's the evangelism of the enthusiast.  That is, as
with other fields people get &quot;hipped&quot; on, converting others can be a
powerful motivation for having a lot of examples to offer: If you don't
like that one, try this one; we'll surely find some you'll really like out
of all these choices, and get you to join me in The Cause.  After all, a
pleasure shared might not be a pleasure doubled, really, any more than
a sorrow (or it is a trouble?) shared is really halved, but the pleasure
is amplified somewhat, just as, if you're lucky, the sorrow can be
attenuated somewhat.
 
And then, whether creditable, or even credible, or not, there's what
happened to me.  My own &quot;research&quot;, as I don't think I ever mentioned
explicitly to the List/Group, didn't really become serious until I had
some of the <b>Glen Grant &quot;Magnificent Old Highland Malt&quot;.  </b>Up until then,
I'd had maybe half a dozen different malt whiskies, and had three or
four (well, maybe five or six) bottles around.  Since it was the early
to mid-'70s, it might be argued that even if I'd tried I couldn't have
amassed more than a dozen or so in this country, but regardless of
that I didn't feel the need to.
 
The <b>MOHM</b>, though, so transcended anything alcoholic I'd ever tasted
that when I eventually discovered (and by then it was the early '80s)
that there would never be any more I decided that I'd launch an effort
to find the world's second best Scotch, dubbed it my real field of
research interest, and started ... researching.  Actually, even in the
later '70s I had been titillated enough by the hope of finding something
comparable to the <b>MOHM</b> to try several of the ones that were becoming
more and more available (in a few specialist shops, in full bottles; if
there were any bars around that had more than the Usual Three, I
wasn't aware of them), and I tended not to finish them because at the
time I was blissfully unaware that they'd deteriorate and was enough of
an evangelist already that having more than a dozen seemed reasonable
when introducing friends to the field; but it wasn't until I got to the
<b>Army&amp;Navy Stores</b> and learned the <b>MOHM</b> had been a private filling and
that they no longer did private fillings, and that <b>Glen Grant</b> no longer
sold the distillate for private fillings from the London <b>Glen Grant</b>
office, that a dozen or so became two or three dozen.
 
It helped somewhat when I discovered the <b>Cairngorm Whisky Centre</b> and
was able to rule out large numbers of candidates all at once, but it
was also the case that I came across a fair number that, while not the
world's second best, still tasted good enough that I felt like having
them around.  And for a while, it did seem tempting to take a
&quot;completist&quot; position and try to have a bottle of every available one,
but I did abandon that goal even before I belatedly learned that they
did deteriorate when open and sitting around for years.  So add
another dozen or two; researchers are expected to have Reference
Collections, aren't they....  (But the &quot;collector&quot; phenomenon does, indeed,
stand as still another reason for variety, and not, I think, an
altogether discreditable one.  There's also variety for the sake of
variety.  There's even, in my own personal case, fondness for bargains
and Trader Joe's former buyer who found a number of attractive-seeming
&quot;buys&quot; right about the time I reluctantly returned to Lotosland.)
 
&quot;Still tasted good enough that I felt like having them around&quot; is
significant, I submit.  For in addition to the consideration that
sometimes you're in the mood for one, sometimes for another, which may
be construed as still another &quot;reason&quot;, it's also the case that if the
motivation is -- I don't really blush to admit it -- at base a
hedonistic one, If it tastes good, buy it can be sufficient justification
(to a gainfully employed bachelor in the '80s who had no other hobbies,
anyway).   So I at least differ from, if not exactly take issue with,
since you're of course entitled to hold the view, your position that
 
&gt;<i>
</I>Meanwhile, I try to understand whisky by exploring the variety offered by
individual distilleries.
&lt;
 
because I don't try to understand it, I try to enjoy it.
 
(Other things, such as G.I. Woe and a policy against getting into the
habit of drinking alone, being equal, of course).
 
NOT meant as a cheap shot or a one-upping, b/t/w, just a tidyish exit
line (though loose ends are acknowledged, esp. w/r/t the pleasures of
understanding and the desirability of finding predictors that might even
lead to a new &quot;world's best&quot;) since this has, as usual, gone on rather
long.  But there ARE a number of reasons why one might wind up having
a lot of examples of malt whisky around, as I expect you knew when you
asked the rhetorical question, and that's the one I'll choose to close
with....

In-Reply-To: Michael Byrne's message of Thu, 22 Aug 1996 10:47:54 -0400
 
I must confess to being somewhat puzzled by the apparent inconsistencies
between what I've seen in what passes for real life with me and what you've
described, but perhaps there's a link in the chain that hasn't quite come
through yet which, if it's in fact there, would reconcile the phenomena.
 
Which is to say that in my visits to ... &quot;an indepedent bottler&quot; is
probably the appropriate way to avoid packdrill, I've seen a number of,
what, 12 or 16 oz. bottles labelled with as I recall handwritten distillery
names, cask numbers, ages, and proofs, filling in lines on printed and/or
stamped forms that I'd ... unthinkingly thought came from the distilleries
themselves, if I can put it that way.  But if the distilleries don't sell
single casks, and I've no reason to dispute you on that statement, then my
unexamined assumption as to the sample bottles' provenance is clearly
wrong.  (Or at least the assumption that they came DIRECTLY from the
distilleries themselves is clearly wrong.)  So I'm wondering if there is a
whole stratum we haven't explicitly heard about of what might or might not
be called &quot;whisky factors&quot; who serve as middlemen [technical term, immune
from P.C. censure] between the distilleries and the independent bottlers.
Can you -- or anybody else in the trade or who's read up on it somewhere
authoritative more recently than I (or whose memory's better than mine
regardless of when the reading was, of course) -- cast any light on that?
For that matter, were you trying to say that and I just didn't read your
msg aright, since I did go into a somewhat spinning headstate trying to
follow that poor little cask in the first part?
 
(I imagine that if there are such things as factors and if any are
&quot;lurking&quot; on the List/Group we'll never ever hear from any of them
&quot;uncloaked&quot; since they'd presumably not want to be driven mad by scores of
requests for deals.  I would, however, be more than glad to protect their
anonymity if any were let me e-know they were there, and might even be
foolish enough to offer to play coefficient to their prime factors, or
something.)
 
 
There is one ray of light I might be able to throw on the situation from a
different angle, b/t/w:  I think I have it on good authority that there is,
or at least was, a technical term called the &quot;private filling&quot;.  It might
well be that Seagram stopped doing them before Brother Byrne's time with
them, but it was indeed in the context of Seagram that I first heard of
them.  This was when I was trying to track down the <b>Glen Grant &quot;Magnificent
Old Highland Malt&quot; in London</b> in what I believe to have been the Fall of
1982, and I was told by the then-Wine and Spirits Manager  (or Assistant
Manager; I really do forget, and am not merely trying to preserve anonymity
though on second thought I should be anyway) at the <b>Army &amp; Navy Stores</b> that
the <b>MOHM</b> had been a private filling but their new owner, the House of
Fraser [Extremely] Limited, had decreed that Harrod's was the chain's
prestige wine and spirits outlet and had banned <b>A &amp; N</b> from doing further
private fillings.  (I was also told that no, there wasn't any <b>MOHM</b> cached
away somewhere because &quot;the Directors drank it all,&quot; so apparently They
weren't complete fools, although that might have been the previous
Directors for all I know.)   I then marched over to <b>Glen Grant</b>'s London
office and learned that it was even worse than that because they'd since
been acquired by Seagram [unless memory serves a fault and it was, you
should pardon the expression, Schenley; no, not unless <b></b><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7126705.Charles_MacLean" name="MacLean">Charlie</a>'s <a href="https://www.whiskymax.co.uk/whisky-books/">book</a>'s
serving a fault too; let's assume that Seagram it is] and were no longer
even permited to sell distillate for private fillings since They could make
all the money They wanted selling it at 5 years old in Italy.  So rightly
or wrongly I've always believed there were such things as &quot;private
fillings,&quot; which inherently I'd imagine must be done via direct dealings
with the distilleries unless we want to flout Occam's Razor and postulate
still another middle-entity (or still another role for the still-
hypothetical &quot;factors&quot;?), and either everybody I've spoken to in the
trade since was too polite to call me on using the term in conversation
with them (and that's not a facetious suggestion, since I've been uniformly
impressed by the gentlepersonliness of everybody I've happened across in
the trade), or it actually is a &quot;term of art&quot; or whatever the current
buzzphrase is.
 
So in addition to more detail on who conveys the eggs from the chicken to
grocer perhaps Brother Byrne, who did touch on own-casks but I thought it
was only in the corporate context -- or again other siblings-in-spirit with
certain knowledge of the trade -- would be willing to fill in the gaps on
the &quot;private filling&quot; topic -- unless, of course, it's a trade secret I
wasn't supposed to be privy to in the first place....
 
cheers, map
 
P.S.  Since it's been awhile since I've done so on-List, the customary
afterthought this time certainly should be a reminder that if anybody ever
turns up any of the <b>Army &amp; Navy Store's Glen Grant MOHM</b>, perhaps at an
estate sale or the like, PLEASE let me know.  (The &quot;original&quot; 12 y.o.
Lagavulin in the white packaging, too, of course.)  (And I must add that in
light of still another report that They've mucked up the 16 y.o. I do hope
that if anybody comes up with something ... retributional to do with or to
UD I'll be given the pleasure of hearing about it, anonymously at least.
Ah.  A thought:  since I do believe that UD belong to Guinness, the least I
can do is to assure everybody that in my own humble but dogmatic opinion
Murphy's is a MUCH better stout and hope they'll take that to heart when
and if dabbling in undistilled malted barley products.)
