## the Scotch proto-Blogger

Mike was a Scotch blogger before there was a Web on which have WebLogs &mdash; by the medium of netmail (*as they called it when they were inventing it*, as he'd have said) and file transfer sharing of text files, which he then granted permission for some of the earliest Scotch websites to re-share.

His quest, called &quot;Primary Research Area&quot;, was to find another bottle of the semi-mythical A&N MOHM Glen Grant 14, and secondarily, to determine what was the second-best single-malt after that, which resulted in The Research Notes.

## Pun of the Year for 1986

(Other Puns of the Year [(POTYs)](../SciFi/Letters/potys.html) are filed under [Literary Works](../SciFi/index.html#letters-and-other-literary-works).)

The (D)ARPAnet/MILnet/DDN Internet Research Group (IRG) networking folks had periodic meetings in London and NATO regarding the digitization of allies. Mike regularly stopped off in Scotland on the way home.

> I was asked to give a talk at Edinburgh University, 
> since I was going to be in the neighborhood to do field 
> work in my real area of research interest, what we call single malt Scotch 
> and what they call malt whisky. 
> Having mentioned why I was around at the start of the talk, 
> I was delighted to be invited to take a dram afterwards by 
> a rather seniorlooking gent, up in his office, 
> which turned out to be quite a posh one, 
> making me assume he was quite senior.

> Since he had an appointment in a few minutes 
> and I was supposed to go off to the pub with my local 
> cohorts, we didn't even take time to sit, 
> just exchanged a few pleasantries about our respective books 
> and a thought	or two about the particular malt whisky he'd happened to have in his desk. 
> At the pub, I mentioned the incident to the gang 
> and was informed that my host had been their new Professor of Computer Science, 
> which, I might not now, was a relatively more distinguished rank there than in the States.

> I replied that I had known that, but was pleased with the information anyway 
> since it would make the event all the more memorable. 
> Then I added that I had just realized I'd have had to remember it forever anyway, 
> since it was, after all, the first talk I'd ever given 
> that had received a standing libation.
