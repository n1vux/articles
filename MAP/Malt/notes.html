(and possibly final) Edition<br> &copy; M. A. Padlipsky <br><br>
</center>In case it's not clear from context, these Notes
represent &nbsp;<i>my</i>&nbsp;
impressions of the listed "instantiations"; others' tastes, and other
bottlings, will differ. In particular, I'm very fond of the Islay
style, which is typically much peatier than what beginners are likely
to be comfortable with, so be warned. B/t/w, I am now convinced that
being open for a long time <i>does</i>&nbsp;
adversely affect some flavors.<br>

Notes.............<br>
</strong></center><p><strong>Aberfeldy </strong>
| H | 17 | 40 | G | R | [<i>&radic;</i>&nbsp;
]:<br> Very like Highland Park to my palate; probably not enough
better to justify the price differential, but certainly not to be
scorned.</p><p>
<strong>Aberlour</strong> | H | 20 | 51 | O | C4 | [<i>&radic;</i>
(-)]:<br> Could have been a Braes in a sweeter sherry cask. (CWC
bottling.)<br>
<strong>------</strong> | H | 10 | 43 | D | R | [<i>&radic;
</i>-]:<br> ("Very Old Highland Malt") Like Mortlach, but
less sharp;
decent flavor/"smoke," somewhat thin, but better than remembered.<br>
<strong>------ </strong>
| H | OTS | OTS | D | C1 | [ - ]:<br> Heavyish, but somehow thin.</p><p>
<strong>Allt-a' Bhainne</strong> | H | 14 | 55.8 | D | S | [<i>&radic;
</i>-]:<br> (Cask 108.2) Lightish, sharpish nose but not
unpleasant. Same for taste, w/ good texture. Seemed largely unaffected
by water. Some breathing helps. </p><p>
<strong>Ardbeg</strong> | I | ? | ? | A | A | [ <strong>*</strong>
]:<br> This is the first one tasted at Adelphi and there's
confusion about which cask it was but no doubt that it was magnificent.
You can tell it's coming at arm's length, and it's about the only one I
could go moonwalking over: I really did imagine myself on a pier with
treated wooden pilings. (It's presumably the bourbon-casked 17 y.o. @
52.8% I've got the factchit on, but...?) Its immensity, and its place
of origin, prompted me to pick what I thought was it over the
technically superior 28 y.o. Springbank [q.v.] to take home at the time.<br>
<strong>------ </strong>
| I | 29 | 52.8 | Sn | R | [<i>&radic; </i>
++ / <b>*</b> ]:<br> (Butt 574) The hit of C4, from
the dark oloroso cask. "Tastes like the best Mac I ever tasted first
crack out of the bottle." Might go to full <strong>*</strong>
when I risk opening the bottle I brought home, since what I recall is
the richness and smoothness of the 18 y.o. Mac plus enough peat to make
it even more to my taste.<br>
<strong>------ </strong>
| I | 29 | 52.8 | Sn | C4 | [<i>&radic; </i>
+]:<br> From the pale oloroso cask, "but you wouldn't believe it
was the same distillery; no iodine, not much peat, but tastes divine --
or at least damn good" is the field note.<br>
<strong>------ </strong>
| I | 22 | 40 | G | C4 | [<i>&radic; </i>
+]:<br> The best iodine I ever tasted. Amazingly smooth for the
nose. <br>
<strong>------ </strong>
| I | 19 | 57 | A | R | [<i>&radic; </i>
+]:<br> This is the Adelphi that I did get the bottle of, and
have tasted a sample of another bottle of, so far. It's not quite the
same thing as we had on Gloucester Lane: you have to bend your arm to
know it's coming. (Might well score higher if it weren't for the
disappointment that it doesn't appear to be the one I tasted Over
There.)<br>
<strong>------ </strong>
| I | 18 | 40 | G | r | [<i>&radic; </i>
(+)]:<br> This would probably score higher if it weren't for all
the amazing cask strength competition.<br>
<strong>------</strong> | I | 10 | 40 | D | C1,C4 | [<i>&radic;</i>&nbsp;
]:<br> "Light peat." per C1; good peat per C4 and grade adjusted
accordingly, esp. in light of how many other instantiations have become
considerable favorites (and of the fact that the C4 taste might well be
the last available of the old OTS). I did it an injustice in '83. (And
there's an SMWS one in the Appendix that I also quite liked, so I think
it's fair to say this is one of my favorite distilleries; pity I didn't
know that when I was on <i>hadj</i>
.)</p><p>
<strong>Ardmore </strong>
| H | OTS | OTS | D | C2 | [<i>&radic; </i>
--]:<br> Slightly on the thin and sharp side, but reasonable
flavor.</p><p>
<strong>Auchentoshan</strong> | L | OTS | OTS | D | R | [ -
]:<br> More authoritative than, say, Littlemill; some flavor.</p><p>
<strong>Aultmore</strong> | H | OTS | OTS | D | C2 | [<i>&radic;
</i>(-)]:<br> Almost very light, but smooth and with good
flavor; might be good introduction.</p><p>
<strong>Balblair</strong> | H | OTS | OTS | D | C2 | [<i>&radic;</i>&nbsp;
]:<br> Very good flavor, though not really peaty; somewhat sharp,
but not annoyingly so; doesn't linger.</p><p>
<strong>Ballindalloch Castle</strong> | H | 19 | 58.3 | D |
C4 | [<i>&radic; </i> +]:<br> A Cragganmore Private
Stocked for the Castle by CWC (dist. '70, bot. '89). Lovely nose,
lovely taste, even if Ron does like it. [Heh, heh.]<br>
<strong>------</strong> | H | 20 | 45.6 | D | C4 | [<i>&radic;
</i>(+)]:<br> Not the other, but still damn good. (Dist.
'73, bot. '93)</p><p>
<strong>Balmenach</strong> | H | OTS | 80B | D | C1 | [<i>&radic;
</i> -]:<br> Some fruit; proof came through when originally
tasted.</p><p>
<strong>Balvenie </strong>
| H | 12 | 43 | D | R | [<i>&radic;</i>&nbsp; ]:<br>
The "Doublewood", and rather good if not quite doublegood.<br>
<strong>------ </strong> | H | OTS | OTS | D | C2 | [<i>&radic;
</i> -]:<br> Lightish; less sharp than Glengoyne, say.<br>
<strong>------ </strong>
| H | 15 | 50.4 | D | C4 | [ - ]:<br> (Cask 94) Almost sour nose;
not very tasty taste.</p><p>
<strong>Benriach</strong> | H | "1969" | 40 | G | O | [<i>&radic;
</i> -]:<br> Nice nose, sl. bite, fair flavor, but
Cragganmore better and cheaper.</p><p>
<strong>Benrinnes </strong>
| H | 22 | 56.3 | A | O | [<i>&radic; </i> -]:<br> (Dist.
'74) It was actually greenish to look at. At first blush, piney, but of
the OK kind; since this was a "serious" tasting, I managed to get a
hint of caramel (out of my right nostril), and even concurred that
there might be some raspberry jam lurking; not a big nose, but not a
bad nose. After dilution, a bit of a rubbery nose, which went away,
then almost a mentholish aroma. The taste was light, in keeping with
looking like a white wine of some sort. The cheap shot was "It would go
well with fish." (Mein host <i>almost</i>&nbsp;
believed me.)<br>
<strong>------ </strong>
| H | 15 | 43 | D | C4 | [<i>&radic; </i>
-]:<br> A hint of resin or even turpentine to the nose, but
smooth and fairly flavorful with some peat to the palate.</p><p>
<strong>Benromach</strong> | H | 17 | 62.3 | Gh | R | [ - ]:<br>
Penetrating though not unpleasant nose, but really wants too much water
to take the "fire" out. (Bought for too much money as birthday present,
mainly because G&amp;M had bought the distillery as their 100th
b.d. pres. to themselves and it was by my count my 100th distillery
tasted, not counting grainers.)<br>
<strong>------ </strong>
| H | 12 | 40 | D/G | R | [ - ]:<br> Well, it was "launched"
while I was at the CRF, so I felt I had to shlep some home....</p><p>
<strong>Bladnoch</strong> | L | OTS | OTS | D | C2 | [ - ]:<br>
Sharpish, thinnish, not peaty.<br>
<strong>------ </strong>
| L | 11 | 59 | A | r | [ - ]:<br> I could be convinced there was
a bit of banana oil to the undil. nose; proof swamps taste undil. but
texture good. Dil.: nose almost softly acrid, taste still submerged.
Re-dil.: rather delicate, sweet; OK as a teatime malt, but no
perceptible peat and no mark (on a tough grading day).</p><p>
<strong>Blair Athol</strong> | H | OTS | OTS | D | C1 | [X]:<br>
Not recommended (per original scorecard; no specific notes).</p><p>
<strong>Bowmore</strong> | I | OTS | 43 | D | R | [ - ]:<br>
Sharp; not peaty enough for an Islay, if you believe in the Islay
stereotype (or take it as a desideratum, as I do).</p><p>
<strong>Braes of Glenlivet</strong> | H | 16- | 43 | Sn |
C4 | [<i>&radic; </i>
(-)]:<br> Light but pleasant. (Dist. 6/79, bot. 5/95.) </p><p>
<strong>Brechin</strong> [See <strong>North Port</strong>
]</p><p>
<strong>Brora</strong> | H | 22 | 61.1 | D | C4 | [<i>&radic;
</i>(+)]:<br> Mild, sl. sweet nose at first, a wee bit of
iodine later. Nice Islayish taste. Take that, stereotypists.<br>
<strong>------ </strong>
| H | | 40 | G | C4 | [<i>&radic; </i>
(+)]:<br> (Dist. '72) Yeasty/iodiney nose at first. Airing seems
to have lost the nose, or maybe it was drinking the cask strength
first, but the taste is surprisingly smooth and the flavor nearly
delicate in comparison but still quite nice. Good peat. </p><p>
<strong>Bruichladdich</strong> | I | OTS | OTS | D | C2 | [
- ]:<br> Also not peaty enough; sharpish.</p><p>
<strong>Bunnahabhain </strong>
| I | OTS | OTS | D | C1 | [<i>&radic; </i>
-]:<br> Mild; reasonable peat on roof of mouth; might be
benefiting from C1 grade inflation though (was somewhat disappointing
in restaurant later).</p><p>
<strong>Caledonian</strong> | G | 21 | 46 | Cad | C4 | [<i>&radic;
</i>--]:<br> For once, Cadenhead sprang for a good sherry
cask, even if it was to put a grain whisky in. A sourish nose, but not
unpleasant taste, though somehow strange; it was given to me "blind"
and I certainly wouldn't have placed it as a grain whisky, though I was
aware that it was atypical.</p><p>
<strong>Cameron Brig</strong> | G | OTS | OTS | OTS | C1 |
[ - ]:<br> Not worth digging up the original field notes for, and
not included in previous editions because there was basically nothing
to it; now, though, both for the contrast to the Caledonian and for the
distillery headcount, it gets in.</p><p>
<strong>Caol Ila</strong> | I | 20 | 56.8 | A | A | [<i>&radic;
</i>+]:<br> (Cask 8078, dist. '76) When tasted on
Gloucester Lane, this one struck me as being almost as immense as the
Ardbeg I'd had there the previous August: granted, you couldn't tell it
was coming at arm's length, but you certainly didn't need to bend the
arm fully. Very enjoyable, but it helps to be passionately committed to
the Islay stereotype....<br>
<strong>------</strong> | I | "1978" | 40 | O | R | [<i>&radic;
</i>+]:<br> Ian got ripped off for this at Prestwick, but
it turned out to taste better than 15 y.o. Laphroaig on first tasting
at home. ("Spirit of Scotland" bottling.)<br>
<strong>------ </strong>
| I | 13 | OTS | G | r | [<i>&radic;</i>&nbsp;
]:<br> Not as outstanding a representative of the distillery as
their (G&amp;M's) Port Ellen is, to my taste, but a good
instantiation, natheless.<br>
<strong> ------ </strong> | I | 16 | OTS | G | C1,C3 | [<i>&radic;
</i>(-)]:<br> Good, but not particularly peaty; doesn't
linger (C1). Mild but clearly Islay (C3).</p><p>
<strong>Caperdonich</strong> | H | OTS | OTS | D | C2 | [<i>&radic;
</i> -]:<br> Light, smooth.</p><p>
<strong>Cardhu</strong> | H | 12 | 43 | D | R | [<i>&radic;
</i> -]:<br> Marked light and pleasant during C1; probably
lacks depth based on later acquisition on bargain sale (with rebate,
even).</p><p>
<strong>Clynelish</strong> | H | 11 | 61 | A | r | [<i>&radic;
</i>(-)]:<br> (Dist. '84) A pronounced nose, rather nice.
Some initial sense of peat, but rather sweet after watering; later
almost acrid, and more like smoke than peat, so I guess they're not
interchangeable terms to me after all. Decent texture.<br>
<strong>------ </strong>
| H | OTS | OTS | D | C2 | [<i>&radic; </i>
-]:<br> Perhaps a touch heavier than medium; nice burst of flavor.</p><p>
<strong>Coleburn</strong> | H | 18 | 66.3. | S | S | [<i>&radic;
</i>-]:<br> (Cask 56.9) Sharpish nose, nice texture, fair
flavor undiluted; almost lurking lavender taste after first dilution.</p><p>
<strong>Cragganmore</strong> | H | OTS | OTS | D | R | [<i>&radic;</i>&nbsp;
]:<br> Pleasant, though rather light; might be more to it than
apparent at first tasting. Retry during C3 suggested it was a bit
better than graded before, and C4 CWC bottlings make it a Good
Distillery Club member.</p><p>
<strong>Craigellachie</strong> | H | 12 | OTS | G | C2 | [<i>&radic;
</i>(-)]:<br> Might be the best of the light ones.<br>
<strong>------ </strong> | H | 20 | OTS | Cad | C3 | [ - ]:<br>
Slightly sharp, some flavor, almost worth a mark. Cadenhead apparently
strikes again, since the younger version was better.</p><p>
<strong>Dailuaine</strong> | H | 18 | 40 | D | R | [<i>&radic;</i>&nbsp;
]:<br> A particular favorite of Frank Clark, perhaps because of
its very good nose; I find it a bit too sharp still but record a higher
grade out of respect for the Precentor of the Central Research
Facility. Again, it's in the Reference Collection more because of an
attractive price than anything else.</p><p>
<strong>Dallas Dhu</strong> | H | 13 | 40 | G | R | [<i>&radic;
</i>-(-)]:<br> Light and not very amusing, but fairly
smooth and not at all bad; a shot in the dark self-present.</p><p>
<strong>Dalmore</strong> | H | OTS | OTS | D | C2 | [<i>&radic;
</i>?]:<br> "Smooth, somewhat rich" (but I wonder about
grade inflation, especially when looking back at Dailuaine). [And
wondered even more after tasting the next two for the 4th edn., so
added the "?".]<br>
<strong>------ </strong>
| H | 24 | 43 | O | r | [ - ]:<br>
("Cooper's Choice") Promising nose but 'way too much "heat to flavor".
One wonders if one was told too low a proof.<br>
------ | H | 12 | 43 | D | R | [ - ]: <br> I suspect Trader
Joe's got a bargain because this was an off lot, perhaps a victim of
the dreaded bourbon cask fudging. It's very like the Cooper's Choice
one, with even higher h/f.</p><p>
<strong>Dalwhinnie</strong> | H | 15 | 43 | D | R | [<i>&radic;</i>&nbsp;
]:<br> Actually good. [An X in earlier editions, because Frank
Clark had warned me against the 8 y.o. during C1 but the current one is
just fine.]</p><p>
<strong>Deanston</strong> | H | OTS | OTS | D | C2 | [ - ]:<br>
Thin; very slight bite; v. sl. smokiness.</p><p>
<strong>Dewar's Pure Malt</strong> | V| OTS | OTS | D | O |
[ - ]:<br> Inoffensive but undistinguished -- and it <i>is</i>&nbsp;
a vatted, as earlier conjectured.</p><p>
<strong>Drumguish</strong> | H | 3/4? | 40 | D | C4 | [ - ]:<br>
(No age given but known to be very young) "Grainy". Not much taste but
harsher than the proof suggests; earthy. Gives a sense that it will
probably age better than the Rhosdhu, but it, too, shouldn't have been
sent out into the world before pubescence, much less maturity.</p><p>
<strong>Dufftown</strong> | H | 10 | 40 | D | C4 | [ - ]:<br>
Not much to it, but not the X the 8 y.o. was. (As with the Dalwhinnie
8, Frank Clark steered me off it during C1 simply because he didn't
think either was worth the tasting in those instantiations.)<br>
<strong>------ </strong>
| H | 8 | OTS | D | C1? | [ X ]:<br> Not recommended (per old
scorecard; no explicit notes).</p><p>
<strong>Edradour</strong> | H | 10 | 40 | D | R | [<i>&radic;
</i>&nbsp;/<i>&radic; </i>
- ]:<br> C3 note was "smoother but lighter than remembered". The
13 y.o. is a particular favo[u]rite of Ron Smith, Frank Clark's
assistant, but I remain somewhat dubious about the 10.<br>
<strong>------</strong> | H | 21 | 46 | Cad | r | [<i>&radic;
</i>-]:<br> Much paler in color than the distillery issue
and, with apologies to Chris Perry and John Henshall, rather harsher to
my taste, although that might just reflect the somewhat higher proof;
still, I can't account it one of Cadenhead's rare successes, even if
they probably did spring for oak casks on this one.</p><p>
<strong>Glen Albyn</strong> | H | OTS | OTS | D | C2 | [ -
]:<br> Sweet; "not whisky" but not bad for whatever it is.</p><p>
<strong>Glenallachie</strong> | H | 12 | OTS | D? | C3 | [
- ]:<br> Light; not unpleasant.</p><p>
<strong>Glenburgie</strong> | H | 15 | 40 | G | C4 | [ - ]:<br>
Not bad, but not worth a mark.</p><p>
<strong>Glen Deveron</strong> | H | 12 | 43 | D | R | [X?]:<br>
This is supposed to be the younger sibling of MacDuff, and came out
somewhat better than it during C3, but the bottle I got on sale in the
States is so peppery that it's either flawed or I missed an X over
there. [Did "cool off" after being opened for a year or so.]</p><p>
<strong>Glendronach </strong>
| H | 12 | 43 | D | R | [<i>&radic; </i>
(+)]:<br> Given "good character, good flavor" during C1 and
hasn't disappointed since; might warrant a slightly higher grade.<br>
<strong>------</strong> | H | 22 | 40 | G | R | [<i>&radic;
</i>(+)]:<br> It's a close call, but I suspect the younger
is
actually slightly better.</p><p>
<strong>Glendullan</strong> | H | OTS | OTS | D | R | [ - ]:<br>
Somewhat sharp; not distinguished.</p><p>
<strong>Glen Elgin</strong> | H | OTS | OTS | D | O | [ - ]:<br>
Didn't leave a clear impression, so is presumably not memorable.</p><p>
<strong>Glenesk</strong> | H | OTS | OTS | D | C2 | [ - ]:<br>
Thin; not much flavor.</p><p>
<strong>Glenfarclas</strong> | H | 15 | 46 | D | R | [<i>&radic;
</i>+]:<br> Probably the Highland of choice if you don't
like the Macallan style; good character, but not on the sweet side.<br>
<strong>------</strong> | H | 21 | 43 | D | C3 | [<i>&radic;
</i>(+)]:<br> Mild for the breed, but quite good; would be
interesting to do a direct comparison with the 15 y.o.<br>
<strong>------ </strong> | H | 8 | 105B | D | R | [<i>&radic;</i>&nbsp;
]:<br> The grade might be slightly high out of regard to the
pleasant surprise of being able to deal with the proof at last, but
there is a nice, almost flowery flavor underneath according to the C3
notes.<br>
<strong>------ </strong>
| H | 17 | OTS | D | O | [<i>&radic;</i>&nbsp;
]: <br> The distillery 17 y.o. that has perversely replaced the
15 in the U.S. market until and unless I talk the importer into
changing back (unless I was misled at the distillery during C4 and it's
their idea not to export it to the States). It just doesn't strike me
as being as good as the reference standard 15er. But it's still very
good.<br>
<strong>------ </strong>
| H | 17 | 53.2 | Gh | r | [<i>&radic; </i>
(-)]: <br> Slightly thin but penetrating nose; similar to the
Adelphi Clynelish according to two out of three noses. Reasonable
texture. A hint of marzipan on later sniffing, even after water, again
to two out of three noses, mine of which does like marzipan. If it
weren't for the variability of diluting a cask strength I'd probably
rank it equal to the distillery 17er.<br>
<strong>------</strong> | H | 12 | 43 | D | R | [<i>&radic;
</i>&nbsp;/<i>&radic; </i>
(-)]:<br> Not quite so smooth as the age might suggest, but good
flavor and a certain lightness to it, though perhaps a bit sharp.<br>
<strong>------</strong> | H | 8 | 40 | D | R | [<i>&radic; </i>
&nbsp;/<i>&radic; </i>
(-)]:<br> Very smooth for the age and light for the label, but
maybe a bit shy on flavor compared to siblings.</p><p>
<strong>Glenfiddich</strong> | H | 10 | 43 | D | R | [ - ]:<br>
Rather sharp and harsh; not much flavor or peat, but drinkable in a
wide-top glass. A triumph of adverti[z|s]ing (and it did get me
started, if the truth be known).</p><p>
<strong>Glenforres</strong> | V| 12 | 43 | D | R | [ - ]:<br>
Rather sharp, almost soapy, but not really bad; could nearly be worth a
mark. [Actually a vatted.]</p><p>
<strong>Glen Garioch</strong> | H | OTS | OTS | D | R | [<i>&radic;

peat. (And is apparently pron. "geary".)</p><p>
<strong>Glenglassaugh</strong> | H | 12 | 55.7 | S | S | [<i>&radic;</i>&nbsp;
]:<br> (Cask 21.8) Nice nose, with some peat underneath something
sweet, maybe even the butterscotch the Panel burbled -- but none of the
"dish of seafood". Good taste and texture, though the Port Ellen 43.10
was probably more satisfying.</p><p>
<strong>Glengoyne</strong> | H | OTS | OTS | D | C2 | [<i>&radic;

too liberally, since it came early in C2).</p><p>
<strong>Glen Grant</strong> | H | 14 | 43(?) | O | O | [ <b>**</b>
]:<br> This is the "Magnificent Old Highland Malt" label.
Transcendentally smooth: The Greatest. A private filling by the Army
&amp; Navy Stores, it's no longer available, but when it was there
was nothing like it; richer than the 25 y.o. Macallan, perhaps a bit
less sweet, but peatier, it's the ultimate fond memory. Anybody who
finds a bottle should let me know immediately.<br>
<strong>------</strong> | H | 12 | OTS | D | C2 | [<i>&radic;

actually have deserved a somewhat better grade but for the
disappointment that it wasn't as good. I'd imagine that the distillery
doesn't use sherry casks; A&amp;N clearly did.<br>
<strong>------ </strong> | H | 21 | 43 | D | R | [<i>&radic;

disappointing; sharper than one would expect for the age, but still
reasonable smoothness and decent flavor; a bit better than Mortlach,
perhaps.<br>
<strong>------</strong> | H | 15 | 43 | O | R | [<i>&radic;

<strong>------</strong> | H | 10 | 43 | O | R | [<i>&radic;

Fine Wines
etc.), in a very old packaging of nice decanters; both drinkable,
though somewhat corky by now. (Found in father's basement by some other
customer of his; sold to me for token price.)<br>
<strong>------</strong> | H | (8) | 40 | D | O | [ - ]:<br>
This is what was on the shelf when the kindly gentleman at G.G.'s
London office insisted on sending me a miniature by messenger after
explaining that not only weren't A&amp;N allowed to do private
fillings anymore but even if they were G.G. was not selling distillate
anymore. The gesture was more consoling than the contents, which were
an undistinguished, unacknowledgedly young malt.</p><p>
<strong>Glen Keith</strong> | H | OTS | OTS | D | C2 | [ -
]:<br> Sharpish, lightish.</p><p>
<strong>Glenkinchie</strong> | L | 10 | 43 | D | R | [ - ]:<br>
Austere nose but sharp taste. Needs watering ("high heat to flavor
ratio" as Rob puts it), but not terrible thereafter.</p><p>
<strong>Glenlivet, "The"</strong> | H | 12 | 43 | D | R | [
- ]:<br> Didn't seem all that bad during C1, but by C2 it came
off quite poorly at the distillery; a bartender's mistake in San
Antonio led to the discovery that an Old-fashioned (?; anyway
wide-topped, squat) glass takes the curse off it and other overharsh
ones. Another triumph of adverti[z|s]ing.<br>
<strong>------ </strong>
| H | 17 | 56.5 | Gh | r | [ - ]:<br> Hopeful nose, but prickly
mouth. A bit of peat after dil., but Glenhaven surely didn't spring for
the casks the distillery did for the Highland Lady [q.v.]. Another
barely not worth a mark.</p><p>
<strong>Glenlochy</strong> | H | 15 | 60.7 | S | S | [ - ]:<br>
(Cask L62.4. Why L? Dudge said something about that's what the French
want.) I could almost believe there was a smidgen of chocolate around.
Semigood texture but somehow palish flavored. Stayed sharpish after
dilution but still didn't have much flavor.</p><p>
<strong>Glenlossie</strong> | H | 10 | 43 | D | C4 | [ - ]:<br>
Not much to say for it, or against it.</p><p>
<strong>Glen Mhor</strong> | H | OTS | OTS | D | C2 | [ - ]:<br>
Some bite, but some flavor; Frank Clark likes it according to my notes.</p><p>
<strong>Glenmorangie</strong> | H | 10 | 43 | D | R | [<i>&radic;</i>&nbsp;
]:<br> "Certainly the peatiest of the Highlanders and noteworthy
because of being both quite good and widely available; possibly a good
bridge to the Islays for newcomers." is what I said about the '70s
version, but I swear they've changed their style since -- and I've
lowered the grade accordingly.<br>
<strong>------ </strong>
| H | 12+5 | 43 | D | C4 | [<i>&radic; </i>
(-)]:<br> ("Tain L'Hermitage") I like this noticeably more than
the "Port Wood Finish", but I'm told that the PWF has since been
brought down to 43% and am pretty sure I had the 46%, which might well
have contributed to its perceived prickliness.<br>
<strong>------ </strong>
| H | 12+? | 43 | D | C4 | [<i>&radic; </i>
(-)]:<br> ("Madeira Finish") More obvious than the Tain, which I
did prefer by a narrow margin (which is why it's listed ahead of this
one).<br>
<strong>------ </strong>
| H | 18 | 43 | D | R | [<i>&radic; </i>
-(-?)]:<br> Certainly isn't worth the price, to my taste. The
"new" style, not peaty and I'd almost wonder if not bourbon casked--or
at least if so, from the bad years for bourbon casks. (Grade reflects
disappointment of expectations.)<br>
<strong>------ </strong>
| H |12+? | 46 | D | r | [ - ]:<br> ("Port Wood Finish") With due
apologies to the kindly donor, I just didn't like this one. The
prickliness dominated and the moonwalking in the accompanying booklet
got even shorter shrift from me than usual. Butterscotch? Come <i>on</i>
. (And no matter what my well-placed sources say, I don't believe it
was a <i>true</i>&nbsp; "experiment" to go to the wine
finishes: if the bourbon casks hadn't gone bad I just doubt the
experiment would have ... suggested itself. Granted, though, that could
be motivated by the grudge I bear about the missing peat in the 10 y.o.
... and by distaste for the coyness of "at least 12 years in oak and
the last few years in Port Pipes".)</p><p>
<strong>Glen Moray</strong> | H | 10 | 40 | D | R | [<i>&radic;
</i>-(-)]:<br> Fared better during C2 than after it joined
the Collection; was light but flavorful, pleasant before, but I doubt
I'd go that far today. (Perhaps another TJ's non-bargain?)</p><p>
<strong>Glen Ord</strong> | H | 12 | 40 | D | O | [<i>&radic;
</i>--]:<br> The latest renaming, and the one that comes
closest to whisky.</p><p>
<strong>Glenordie</strong> | H | OTS | OTS | D | C2 | [?]:<br>
Very different, almost cognacy; perfumey. Not clear how/whether to
grade it. [Per C4, it's quite likely it was the 12 y.o. @ 40% that was
on the shelf before, but I didn't feel like recalibrating it since I
didn't want to be even more confused (being confused enough).]</p><p>
<strong>Glenrothes</strong> | H | OTS | OTS | D | C2 | [<i>&radic;
</i>(-)]:<br> Very light, quite smooth; might be a good
introduction.<br>
<strong>------ </strong>
| H | 16 | 43 | D | C4 | [<i>&radic; </i>
-]:<br> Somehow tasted more like a good bourbon than a good
Scotch, but not a bad drink, whatever.</p><p>
<strong>Glen Scotia</strong> | H | OTS | OTS | D | C2 | [ -
]:<br> Yeasty nose, not malty/peaty.</p><p>
<strong>Glentauchers</strong> | H | OTS | 40 | G | C4 | [ -
]:<br> (Dist. '79) Yeasty nose? Slightly malty taste. (And a good
place to take judicial notice that G&amp;M really shouldn't have
gotten coy with the distilled dates sans bottled dates bit.)</p><p>
<strong>Glen Turret</strong> | H | 15 | OTS | D | C3 | [<i>&radic;
</i>&nbsp;/<i>&radic; </i>
-]:<br> One of the cases where it's clearly the older, the
better. Compared all three siblings during C3 and age told.<br>
<strong>------ </strong> | H | 12 | OTS | D | C3 | [ - ]:<br>
Still rather light, but noticeably better than the 8 y.o.<br>
<strong>------</strong> | H | 8 | OTS | D | C3 | [ - ]:<br>
Light, not unpleasant; C1 had it as "mild".</p><p>
<strong>Glenugie</strong> | H | OTS | OTS | D | C2 | [<i>&radic;
</i>-]:<br> Good nose, nice taste; light in a funny way.</p><p>
<strong>Glenury-Royal</strong> | H | 23 | 61.3 | D | C4 | [<i>&radic;
</i>(-)]:<br> Rather nice, almost musky taste, when
watered. (Again and again, the caskstrengthers do seem to do better
than the tablestrengthers, don't they.)<br>
<strong>------ </strong>
| H | 12 | OTS | D | C3 | [ - ]:<br> Sharp/slightly metallic;
marginally acceptable.</p><p>
<strong>Highland Lady</strong> | H | 21 | 56 | D | R | [<i>&radic;
</i>+]:<br> This was the other hit of C4. At last I
understand why Glenlivet used to have a good reputation: it's one of
theirs, named after an ancestral Grant (Elizabeth), author of the
1820something <i>Memoirs of a Highland Lady </i>&nbsp;
that had a memorable line about the product, and is rather wonderful,
despite that rather unprepossessing label. (So my new girlfriend bears
a marked resemblance to her late gracious majesty the Queen Empress
Victoria, so what?)</p><p>
<strong>Highland Park</strong> | "H" | 12 | 43.4 | D | R | [<i>&radic;
</i>&nbsp;/<i>&radic; </i>
+]:<br> (So it's from an island; so what's its name?) Good
"weight" and flavor, though perhaps a bit sharp; originally recommended
as a best buy by Dennis Lambert, the grade was higher until after C3
made things much more persnickety.<br>
<strong>------ </strong> | H | 8 | 40 | D | R | [<i>&radic;
</i>(+)]:<br> Got "very slightly sweet, sharper but not
offensively so" during C2, when all four of us did direct comparisons
with the 12 y.o. and were uniformly surprised at how close they were;
&gt; <i>V </i>&nbsp;
might be a better grade if I'd used that notation (in which case the 12
might well be &lt;/= <i>V </i>
+, which would be quite a bore to type).<br>
<strong>------ </strong>
| H | 9 | 43 | O | r | [<i>&radic; </i>
-]:<br> (Whyte&amp;Whyte; dist. '86) Struck me as thinner
than the distillery issue and a tad harsh but had enough peat to get a
mark even on a tough grading day.</p><p>
<strong>Hillside</strong> [See <strong>Glenesk</strong>
] </p><p>
<strong>Imperial</strong> | H | 18 | OTS | Cad? | C1 | [<i>&radic;
</i>+]:<br> One of the big hits of C1, I expect it wouldn't
hold up to further experience, especially since it was probably a
Cadenhead; got "sl. sharp, good flavor" originally.</p><p>
<strong>Inchgower</strong> | H | OTS | OTS | D | C3 | [--
(sic)]:<br> Almost nothing to it: the Miller Beer of malt
whiskies.</p><p>
<strong>Inchmurrin</strong> | H | - | 43 | D | R | [<i>&radic;</i>&nbsp;
]:<br> For a change, a birthday present to me not from me. The
(oenophile) donors all thought they detected <i>creme brule'</i>
.&nbsp; I admitted to suspecting the hay had been mown that day.</p><p>
<strong>Inverleven</strong> | L | OTS | 40 | G | C4 | [<i>&radic;
</i>--]:<br> (Dist. '79) More taste than nose but not
distinguished, though not bad. The grade might be high, actually, but
it came right after Mannochmore and Drumguish....</p><p>
<strong>Isle of Jura </strong>
| H | OTS | OTS | D | C2 | [ - ]:<br> Slightly sharp, light;
flavor OK.</p><p>
<strong>Knockando</strong> | H | OTS | OTS | D | C2 | [<i>&radic;
</i>(-)]:<br> Light but good.</p><p>
<strong>Knockdhu</strong> | H | 14 | 59.9 | A | A | [<i>&radic;</i>&nbsp;
]:<br> This was the "best of the rest" during my first visit to
Gloucester Lane.<br>
<strong>------ </strong> | H | 10 | OTS | G | C3 | [<i>&radic;
</i>-]:<br> Much better flavor than nose.</p><p>
<strong>Lachlan's</strong> | H | 8 | 43 | D | R | [<i>&radic;
</i>(-)]:<br> This is believed by many, including yr obdt
srvt, to be a young Macallan (I'm told the president (?) of Mac
wouldn't confirm or deny but said "I can tell you this: it will never
happen again" to a D.C. whisky lovers group); it certainly tastes like
it, what with the same excellent flavor but somewhat less smoothness
than the 12 y.o., and has to be accounted a Best Buy at the sort of
prices it was going for. [Long gone now.]</p><p>
<strong>Ladyburn</strong> | L | 12 | 43 | D | O | [ - ]:<br>
Mucilage?? Maybe. Not detestable, but not easily characterizable. Hard
to find, but if you never get any, you haven't missed much.</p><p>
<strong>Lagavulin</strong> | I! | 12 | 43 | D | R | [ <strong>*</strong>
]:<br> The major discovery of C1; indeed, THE Islay. Rich, peaty,
and smooth. Not only Top Five, but probably Top Malt (especially since
the older Macallans are so much pricier), though of course that's one
of those matters of taste and some days even I prefer to have the 18 or
25 y.o. Mac. [N.B.: Raves for original white &amp; black packaging
only.]<br>
<strong>------</strong> | I | 16 | OTS | D | O | [<i>&radic;
</i>+]:<br> The current offering; NOT as good as the
original to my palate, but still probably better than 15 y.o.
Laphroaig, regardless of grade. (And Bahs! to United Distillers for
switching to refill casks, no matter how well it sells.)<br>
<strong>------</strong> | I | 15 | 45 | D | R | [<i>&radic;</i>&nbsp;
]:<br> The one in the crock; a somewhat disappointing New Year's
Eve self-present.<br>
<strong>------ </strong> | I | 12 | 43 | D | R | [<i>&radic;</i>&nbsp;
]:<br> The buff packaging Trader Joe's once had; wish I'd bought
more, at the price, but still not the real thing.</p><p>
<strong>Laphroaig</strong> | I | 15 | 45 | D | R | [<i>&radic;
</i>+(+)]:<br> A revelation compared to other bottlings of
it; almost as smooth as Port Ellen, almost as peaty as Lagavulin! Very
limited supply, though. [Ages badly.] {Added 4th Ed.: Supply has picked
up since C2/3, but price has been obscenely jacked up; and the "(+)"
isn't really deserved, except in historical context.}<br>
<strong>------</strong> | I | 28 | 50.6 | Sn | C4 | [<i>&radic;
</i>(+)]:<br>
V. nice nose, somewhat less to the taste than it would suggest, but as
smooth a Laphroaig as I've ever tasted. Another good mark for Signatory.<br>
------ | I | 13 | OTS | O | O | [<i>&radic;</i>&nbsp; ]:<br>
Berry Bros. private filling; the best of the rest, as I recall. <br>
<strong>------</strong> | I | 16 | OTS | G | C3 | [<i>&radic;
</i>-]:<br> Light; surprising.<br>
<strong>------</strong> | I | 14 | OTS | Cad | C2 | [<i>&radic;
</i>-]:<br> Tastes like Laphroaig with a few more years on
it; not worth as much as Talisker, though.<br>
<strong>------</strong> | I | 10 | 43 | D | R | [ - ]:<br>
It really is way too harsh. One wonders how those who find it in bars
or stores manage to develop a taste for the better Islays (but, then,
one did, didn't one?).</p><p>
<strong>Ledaig</strong> | O | OTS | OTS | D | C1 | [<i>&radic;</i>&nbsp;
]:<br> "Well, maybe this is the peatiest of the Highlanders,
since the notes say 'like Lagavulin, less forceful.' Might well get a
lower grade these days. [All gone.]" is what the Note used to be, until
I got the bottle below and noticed it's from the Isle of Mull, in fact.
But I decline to humo[u]r the stereotypists by marking it "I".<br>
<strong>------ </strong>
| O | 20 | 43 | D | R | [ - ]:<br> Sherryish nose. Somewhat bitey
undil., a trace of peat w/ water, but nothing like the C1. Might well
have been casked too long. Barely not worth a mark despite having cost
too much (as the second bottle for the birthday I said I wouldn't get <i>a</i>&nbsp;
bottle for).</p><p>
<strong>Linkwood</strong> | H | OTS | OTS | D | R | [<i>&radic;</i>&nbsp;
]:<br> Reasonable exemplar of the lighter Highland style. Got
"like Knockando but less sharp" on C3 recalibration. [Was a Best Buy
when at Trader Joe's.]</p><p>
<strong>Littlemill</strong> | L | OTS | OTS | D | C3 | [ -
]:<br> Quite light, not peaty, but not too bad.</p><p>
<strong>Lochnagar</strong> | H | OTS | OTS | D | C2 | [ - ]:<br>
Rather thin but fairly smooth; possibly "vanilla" nose; not
particularly interesting.</p><p>
<strong>Lochside</strong> | H | 25 | 63.2 | S | S | [<i>&radic;
</i>-]:<br> (Cask 92.5) Some peat to the nose, but not a
lot, and perhaps again some chocolate. Sharpish taste. Nice texture
after dilution and nose holds up but taste isn't great. Still a hint of
chocolate, though.</p><p>
<strong>Longmorn</strong> | H | 15 | 45 | D | R | [<i>&radic;
</i>&nbsp;/<i>&radic; </i>
-]:<br> "Dry," but good flavor; went down a notch on C3 from C1,
but up enough in '95 to warrant a purchase at the Duty Free.</p><p>
<strong>Longrow</strong> | H | '73 | OTS | D | C3 | [ - ]:<br>
("Peated Springbank") Good, though not quite so rich as Knockdhu.
[Honest, that was the field note and it's too hard to find to
recalibrate.]<br>
<strong>------ </strong>
| C | 8 | 57.7 | Cad | O | [ - ]:<br> Tasted like "Liquid Smoke",
the product. Given the scarcity value and interest in the "distillery",
it might be interesting to see how it is at 12 or 15 or so y.o.,
though, if Cadenhead can be trusted not to try to cash in on all
they've got of it too soon.</p><p>
<strong>Lomond</strong> [See <strong>Inverleven</strong>
]</p><p>
<strong>Macallan</strong> | H | 25 | 43 | D | R | [ <b>*</b>
]:<br> Ever so slightly smoother than the 17/18 y.o.; possibly
fractionally less peaty; not really "worth" twice the price, except to
a fanatic. Probably a bit more nose than the 17; at any rate, certainly
Top Five. [96: And now it's three times the price....]<br>
<strong>------ </strong>
| H | 17/18 | 43 | D | R | [ <b>*</b> ]:<br> In
'63/4/5, they were calling it 17 y.o., but now they seem to think it's
18; whatever, it's Top Five by me, being sweet and rich and better than
the 12 y.o., though like all its siblings in not being particularly
peaty. <i>Vive le</i>&nbsp; sherry casks regardless.<br>
<strong>------ </strong>
| H | 18 | 46 | O | C4 | [<i>&radic; </i>
+]:<br> (CWC bottling) Just about as good as the distillery
issue, though perhaps I was picking up the extra 3%, or perhaps I've
come off the dist. iss. as the years have gone by (and as it's changed
a bit, too, I do suspect).<br>
<strong>------</strong> | H | 12 | 43 | D | R | [<i>&radic;
</i>+]:<br> Good sweetness, with some bite but no
harshness; peat
might be a bit too faint, but it's their style and still one of the
best.<br>
<strong>------</strong> | H | 6 | 104B | D | C3 | [<i>&radic;
</i>&nbsp;/<i>&radic; </i>
+]:<br> Almost astounding for the youth and proof.<br>
<strong>------</strong> | H | 20 | OTS | Cad | C2 | [ <strong>X</strong>
]:<br> To make Macallan taste bad after wasting so many years
must have cost Cadenhead several P for the pine casks. Shameful.<br>
<strong>------</strong> | H | 10 | OTS | D | O | [<i>&radic;
</i>-]:<br> What's fobbed off on the British public; be
sure to get the 12 at the Duty Free if you're not springing for the 18
(or are building your own Reference Collection). [96: And be sure
you're not at the Duty Free that charges more than it would cost OTS in
the States, which one of them does.]</p><p>
<strong>MacDuff</strong> | H | 16 | OTS | G | C3 | [ - ]:<br>
Thinnish; not bad.</p><p>
<strong>MacPhail's</strong> | H | 21 | OTS | G | C3 | [<i>&radic;</i>&nbsp;

available, though.<br>
<strong>------ </strong>
| H | 44! | 40 | G | r | [<i>&radic; </i>
--]:<br> (Dist. '45) A friend speculated 'way too much money for
this curiosity, which was far past its prime. The mark is a courtesy;
nobody else should give them any money for it.<br>
<strong>Mannochmore</strong> | H | 12 | 43 | D | C4 | [ - ]:<br>
Except for the alcohol level, it could be a white wine.</p><p>
<strong>"Old Meldrum"</strong> | H | 12 | 43 | D | O | [<i>&radic;</i>&nbsp;
]:<br> Has to be accounted a very drinkable Highland, but isn't
really cost-effective unless on very good sale; nice, Macallanish sort
of taste to it, though. [As of C4, I'm told it's actually a Glen
Garioch.]</p><p>
<strong>Millburn</strong> | H | 18 | 58.7 | D | C4 | [<i>&radic;
</i>+]:<br> A chocolate nose! And a lovely taste. But for
all I know we finished the last bottle extant (which I do believe was
from the distillery, not an independent, but my field note could be in
error).</p><p>
<strong>Milton-Duff</strong> | H | OTS | OTS | D | C1/2 | [<i>&radic;
</i>-]:<br> Went from "nice, some flavor" to "sharp, some
flavor" C1 to C2, but is at least sometimes available in the Duty Free
so might be worth it at some point.<br>
<strong>------</strong> | H | 20 | 95.5B | D | C3 | [ - ]:<br>
Surprisingly good for the high proof.</p><p>
<strong>Mortlach</strong> | H | 12 | 43.4 | D | R | [<i>&radic;
</i>&nbsp;/<i>&radic; </i>
-]:<br> Slightly sharp, slightly light, but decent
flavor/"smoke"; remembered it as better than it seemed on retasting.
[Possible open bottle damage.]<br>
<strong>------ </strong>
| H | 15 | 40 | G | C4 | [<i>&radic; </i>
(-)]:<br> Nice nose, more fullness of flavor than the 12.<br>
<strong>------ </strong>
| H | 16 | 43 | D | C4 | [<i>&radic; </i>
-]:<br> Sharper nose, taste than the 15 (probably the extra
proof); sl. sourness to the nose.</p><p>
<strong>Mosstowie</strong> | H | 12 | OTS | G | C3 | [<i>&radic;
</i>-]:<br> Light but flavorsome.</p><p>
<strong>North Port</strong> | H | 16 | 62.4 | S | S | [<i>&radic;
</i>--]:<br> (Cask 74.2) Dryish, medium nose. Too sharp
undiluted. Somewhat charred taste.</p><p>
<strong>Oban</strong> | H | 12 | 43 | D | R | [<i>&radic; </i>
-]:<br> Smooth, very slight bite, not long on flavor but barely
worth a mark after entering the Reference Collection by virtue of being
on sale at Trader Joe's for $8 and getting more exposure. [Upgraded
after '91.]</p><p>
<strong>Old Fettercairn</strong> | H | OTS | OTS | D | C3 |
[ - ]:<br> Unassuming, but not really an X despite earlier
indication.</p><p>
<strong>Old Pulteney</strong> | H | 8 | 40 | G | R | [<i>&radic;
</i>+]:<br> One of the revelations of C1, its sweetness is
very appealing even though it really needs more age; the label says
it's bottled by Gordon and MacPhail, and there are rumours of a
Connoisseur's Choice version of it at 13 y.o. Macallanish; somebody
calls it "the manzanilla of the North". Sadly, another one of the good
ones that isn't known to be imported ['96: it might well be by now;
haven't checked, having a spare in hoard].<br>
<strong>------ </strong> | H | 8 | 100B | G? | C3 | [ - ]:<br>
Very different from the lower proof, but again surprisingly drinkable
at the proof.</p><p>
<strong>Old Rhosdhu</strong> | H | 5 | 40 | D | r | [ X ]:<br>
The sample I tasted was somewhere between fetid and foul; what a good
thing it came out of Manny's research budget, not mine. Of course, even
Dalwhinnie was an X when too young so we must admit the logical
possibility that this one might grow up palatable, but as of now if it
were a wine to consume it would be statutory grape.</p><p>
<strong>Old Sheep Dip</strong> | V| OTS | OTS | D | O | [ -
]:<br> It does exist; I actually bought a bottle for a friend who
insisted on bringing bottles to a birthday party. Not bad enough to
rate an X but certainly not enough to it to rate a mark. (And certainly
better than the yucky Old Rhosdhu stuff.)</p><p>
<strong>Ord</strong> | H | OTS | OTS | D | C2 | [ - ]:<br>
Like Glenordie (and they are from the same distillery) in being
"different", only less so; could still be an X on a harsh-grading day.</p><p>
<strong>Pittyvaich</strong> | H | 12 | 43 | D | C4 | [<i>&radic;
</i>--]:<br> Sl. sharp, sl. sweet, sl. flavorful. Every
other sniff the nose is different.</p><p>
<strong>Poit Dubh </strong>
| V| 12 | 40 | D | C1,C2 | [<i>&radic; </i>
-]:<br> A good vatted, but not as good on recalibration as the
first time, when I got a lot of Islay influence in it, perhaps because
of what else I'd had. (Allegedly pron. pot-doo, but Port Dhubai has
been used in my hearing as well.)</p><p>
<strong>Port Ellen</strong> | I | 15 | 40% | G | R | [<i>&radic;
</i>++]:<br> Excellent peat, though lighter and less
characterful than the nonpareil 12 y.o. Lagavulin; very similar to the
15 y.o. Laphroaig, but I like this better. A Top Fiver even if nobody's
yet been clever enough to bring it across the Atlantic River
commercially; its grade went up from first tasting during C2. ['96: It
did get to the States; but beware, the distillery's closed, so....]</p><p>
<strong>"Pride of Islay"</strong>
] | I | 20 | 40 | G | O | [<i>&radic; </i>
-]:<br> Could have sworn Frank Clark introduced this to me as a
vatted, but the label is the standard G&amp;M single malt label, so
unless they made a mistake I guess we count it as a rather light,
perhaps a bit thin pseudonymous Islay (and if it were vatted, why would
they age it so long?).</p><p>
<strong>Prime Malt No. 1</strong> | I | 12 | 45.7 | D | R |
[ - ]:<br> This is supposed to be OTS Laphroaig with an extra two
years; sharpish, reasonably peaty, not exceptional, but drinkable.
['96: Widely supposed to be a Laph. no longer.]</p><p>
<strong>"Pulteney"</strong> | H | 13 | 46 | Cad | R | [ <strong>X!</strong>
]:<br> This is the original Cadenhead pine cask job; it's nothing
like Old Pulteney, and if that's what you're expecting, as I was, it's
terrible! (If that's not what you're expecting, then it's rather like
overpriced, less good Springbank; but what's really needed is the
G&amp;M Connoisseur's Choice 13 y.o. of the real OP, if any still
exists. Let me know if you find it.) [Fobbed off on Research Courier by
Milroy's, whom I also haven't forgiven.]</p><p>
<strong>Rosebank</strong> | L | OTS | OTS | D | C2 | [ - ]:<br>
A little floweriness to commend it, but basically just a Lowlander.
(Or, perhaps better, just another item of support for the Lowland
stylestereotype.)</p><p>
<strong>Royal Brackla</strong> | H | OTS | OTS | D | C3 | [
- ]:<br> Something interesting if undefinable about it; not quite
worth a mark, though.</p><p>
<strong>Royal Lochnagar </strong>
| H | 12 | 40 | D | R | [<i>&radic; </i>
--]:<br> When Pete the Spy brought a bottle to a Billy Do, I
actually thought I noticed a hint of butterscotch, which couldn't have
been from the menu since they'd done one of their prize-winning gumbos
that night. At home it proved to have a pleasant, slightly sweet nose;
a bit bitey, but some peat on the roof of the mouth did gain it a mark.</p><p>
<strong>Sainsbury's</strong> | H | OTS | OTS | D | O | [<i>&radic;
</i>-]:<br> The famous "standing libation," and not bad
whatever it is (Aberlour, maybe?).</p><p>
<strong>Scapa</strong> | H | OTS | OTS | D | C2 | [ - ]:<br>
Somewhat harsh; not really distinguished.<br>
<strong>------</strong> | H | 8 | 100B | D | C3 | [ - ]:<br>
Surprisingly nice for the proof.</p><p>
<strong>"The Singleton"</strong>
] | H | OTS | 40 | D | R | [<i>&radic;</i>&nbsp;
]:<br> ("<strong>of Auchroisk</strong> ") Kindly
brought over by Denis Yaro at Frank Clark's recommendation, this is
certainly tasty, but might well not be worth the list price compared to
Macallan, say; v. reminiscent of some other one, maybe Glen Moray. (I'm
told it's pronounced aw-THRUSK, by the way; and instead of an age, it
just shows bottling year, 1975 in this case.)</p><p>
<strong>Geo.&amp;J.G.Smith Glenlivet</strong> | H |15 |
? | D | O | [<i>&radic; </i>
-]:<br> Not at all bad, whatever it is (presumably an aged "The
Glenlivet," but who knows).</p><p>
<strong>Speyburn</strong> | H | 10 | 40 | D | C4 | [ - ]:<br>
"A nice breakfast malt."</p><p>
<strong>Springbank</strong> | C | 28 | 53.8 | A | R! | [ <b>*</b>
]:<br> I bought this as my 60th birthday present to myself
several years before my 60th birthday because I knew it wouldn't last
very long. Technically superior to the immense Adelphi Ardbeg, I
daresay, though I took the latter home with me out of respect for its
size and origin and sent for the Springer later when it occurred to me
that I'd hate to be without one of it.<br>
<strong>------ </strong>
| C | 32 | 50.8 | A | R | [<i>&radic; </i>
+]:<br> There wasn't any more of the 28 y.o. the next time I was
there, so I consoled myself with this one, which cost more and wasn't
as good, but is still a marvelous dram in an understated way.<br>
<strong>------ </strong>
| C | 21 | 46 | D | R | [<i>&radic; </i>
(+)]:<br> Blind-tasted (it was next to the haggis), I thought I'd
missed a good Islay; still wonder if it doesn't turn out to have been
constructed to the Longrow specs.<br>
<strong>------ </strong> | C | 32/3 | OTS | ? | O | [<i>&radic;
</i>(+)]:<br> This might actually be one of Cadenhead's; if
so, the rare success for them. Two distinct flavors to it, one
sweetish, one "ivyish," made it interesting, but not necessarily worth
the very high price (probably was Cadenhead, at that).<br>
<strong>------</strong> | C | 15 | 43 | D | R | [<i>&radic;</i>&nbsp;
]:<br> This is noticeably a few years smoother than the 12 y.o.,
but probably too pricey to be worth it except on sale unless you really
like the younger version.<br>
<strong>------ </strong>
| C | 12 | 43 | D | R | [<i>&radic;</i>&nbsp;
]:<br> Semi-sweet; good on roof of mouth; a C1 find.</p><p>
<strong>St. Magdalene</strong> | L | 18 | OTS | G | C3 | [<i>&radic;
</i> &nbsp;/<i>&radic; </i> -]:<br> At least as
flavorful as Auchentoshan; wouldn't turn down either.<br>
<strong>------ </strong>
| L | 20 | 58.1 | A | C4 | [<i>&radic; </i>
-]:<br> Very nice nose, but taste not up to it (and funny to be
having an Adelphi in Aviemore -- but I'm told Jamie Walker did spend
some time with Frank Clark in his youth, as it happens.)</p><p>
<strong>Strathisla</strong> | H | OTS | OTS | D | C3 | [ -
]:<br> Too sharp; marginally acceptable.</p><p>
<strong>Strathmill</strong> | H | 11 | 60.6 | Cad | C4 | [
- ]:<br> (Closed a long time.) Slight and/or delicate nose.
"Light; nothing wrong with it."</p><p>
<strong>Talisker</strong> | "I" | 12 | 43.4 | D | R | [<i>&radic;
</i>(+)]:<br> Like a good Islay (though actually from
Skye), but somewhat less peaty; perhaps a bit on the sharp side, though
well worth having on hand and excellent value. [Formerly; still worth
while though.]</p><p>
<strong>Tamdhu</strong> | H | 10 | 40 | D | R | [<i>&radic;
</i>(+)]:<br> Semi-clear, "clean," some peat; grade might
be slightly
inflated because it was tasted at the distillery. (Owned by the "The
Famous Grouse" outfit, as I recall, and Charlie MacLean's book
confirms.)<br>
------ | H | 16 | 46 | Cad | O | [<i>&radic; </i>
(-)]:<br> The rare Cadenhead success; rather nice, even if
somehow thinner than the distillery issue.</p><p>
<strong>Tamnavulin</strong> | H | 10 | OTS | D | C2,C3 | [
- ]:<br> Sharpish but somewhat pleasant; had gotten a mark during
C2, so might be worth conscious recalibration.</p><p>
<strong>Teaninich</strong> | H | 15 | 61.3 | S | S | [<i>&radic;</i>&nbsp;
]:<br> (Cask 59.1) One of the better noses, and nothing at all
wrong w/ the taste.</p><p>
<strong>Tobermory</strong> | V| OTS | OTS | D | C2 | [ - ]:<br>
Relatively smooth, slight bite, not much body/flavor, a little
smokiness. (Actually a vatted, as I recall somewhat sneakily put out by
&lt;EMAM strikes again&gt;.)</p><p>
<strong>Tomatin</strong>
| H | 12 | 43 | D | R | [<i>&radic; </i> -(-)]:<br>
Marginally better than the 10 y.o., and a Trader Joe's bargain.<br>
<strong>------ </strong>
| H | 10 | 43 | D | R | [<i>&radic; </i> --]:<br> Somewhat
sharp/thin; some "smoke;" like Glenforres, another that's "on the
bubble" w/r/t being worth a mark.<br>
<strong>------</strong> | H | 3 | OTS | D | C3 | [ - ]:<br>
Not so harsh as one might expect from the extreme youth.</p><p>
<strong>Tomintoul</strong> | H | OTS | OTS | D | C2 | [ - ]:<br>
Slightly malty nose; taste not up to it though.</p><p>
<strong>Tormore</strong> | H | OTS | OTS | D | R | [ - ]:<br>
Slightly sharp; light; somewhat fuller than Jura, which it resembles.</p><p>
<strong>Tullibardine</strong> | H | OTS | OTS | D | C2 | [
- ]:<br> Sharp, though fair "feel"; some nose, but not memorable.</p><p>
<strong>[(Withheld)] </strong>
| V| OTS | 40 | D | O | [<i>&radic; </i> (-)]:<br> The
name must be withheld because the tasting (at Charlie MacLean's) was
pre-"launch" and I'm not going to waste the transatlantic phone call to
find out if I'm at liberty to divulge it yet, but it was from a very
well known blender and was a good enough vatted to rate a Note.
"Mid-gold" color, nearly liquorice nose undil., nearly menthol-mint w/
water. Taste goes more foliagey, maybe even ivy. "Nose-feel" (hey,
that's what the sheet asks about) light/delicate; "Mouth-feel" half a
stone the right side of thin.<br>
<br></p><center><strong>SMWS Appendix/Addendum<br>
</strong></center><br>Since you can only get the
Scotch Malt Whisky Society cask strength
bottlings from SMWS, I've listed them separately, except for the ones
that represent my only exposure to the distillery. Format changed to
collapse Source and Venue fields into SMWS Cask Number, b/t/w, and Age
and Proof reversed to keep Proof from being next to Cask.<br>
<p><strong>Aberfeldy </strong>
| H | 58.2 | 18 | 60.2 (r) | [<i>&radic; </i> -]:<br>
Better taste than nose neat; same nose but still reasonable taste
watered.</p><p>
<strong>Ardbeg</strong> | I | 60.8 | 12 | 33.9 (R)| [<i>&radic;
</i> &nbsp;/<i>&radic; </i> +]:<br> Yes, it <i>is</i>&nbsp;
peaty; and was what I bought as the Member's Bottle. (33.11 still good
in '91.) [But it lost a lot over not that many years of being open, as
noted in '95, even.]</p><p>
<strong>Ardmore</strong> | H | 59.6 | 11 | 66.3 | [<i>&radic;
</i> -]:<br> Rather nice.</p><p>
<strong>Balblair</strong> | H | 63.7 | 10 | 70.1 | [<i>&radic;
</i> (+)]:<br> "I seem to recall quite liking it"; other
sheet has "lovely taste".</p><p>
<strong>Balmenach</strong> | H | 65.2 | 11 | 48.3 | [<i>&radic;
</i> -]:<br> Too late in the night to have a sound opinion,
but not at all bad.</p><p>
<strong>Benrinnes</strong> | H | 60.3 | 13 | 36.6 | [<i>&radic;
</i> -]:<br> Amazing color difference from/to/than the
Adelphi: deep amber vs. greenish/winey. Sl. sharp nose, penetrating
though no clear scent impression but again hints of chocolate, which
suggests there might be something wrong with my nose tonight but an
independent observer confirmed on this one, anyway.</p><p>
<strong>Blair Athol</strong> | H | 59.4 | 10 | 68.1 | [<i>&radic;</i>&nbsp;
]:<br> Pleasant surprise.</p><p>
<strong>Bowmore</strong> | I | 57.9 | 13 | 3.7 | [<i>&radic;
</i> (-)]:<br> Clearly an overproof, but not at all bad;
Islayish, anyway.</p><p>
<strong>Bruichladdich</strong> | I | 57 | 14 | 23.2 | [<i>&radic;
</i> -]:<br> All right if you like that sort of thing.</p><p>
<strong>Dailuaine</strong> | H | OTS | OTS | 41.1 | [<i>&radic;</i>&nbsp;
]:<br> Everybody tells me I quite liked it.<br>
<strong>------ </strong>
| H | 60.4 | 10- | 41.6 (R) | [?]:<br> (Dist. 6/86, bot. 5/96)
The (assigned, not chosen, this time 'round) Member Bottle on rejoining
in '96; unopened at time of writing, but Dudge says it's crap (and
might even have meant it since he did offer to swap it for a North
Port, which I didn't have the time/strength to take him up on).</p><p>
<strong>Dalmore</strong> | H | 66 | 9 | 13.3 | [ - ]:<br>
'89: "Perhaps too challenging for what's left of my palate."</p><p>
<strong>Deanston</strong> | H | 55,56.2 | 12,11 | 79.2/.3 |
[ - ]:<br> .2: Light nose, sharp but interesting flavor; .3: Very
overwritten in SMWS Quarterly.</p><p>
<strong>Glen Albyn</strong> | H | 61.3 | 10 | 69.1 | [<i>&radic;</i>&nbsp;
]:<br> Another pleasant surprise w/r/t OTS I seem to recall. I
got vanilla out of it in the nose, no matter what They say.</p><p>
<strong>Glenburgie</strong> | H | 60.7,61 | 9 | 71.1/.2 | [<i>&radic;
</i>(-),<i>&radic; </i>
(+)]:<br> .1: Sweet sherry cask but v. surprisingly not the more
to my taste of the two. .2: Lighter sherry -- and I thought I like
sherry. Must be the influence of the man I met on the street who turned
out to have owned the maltings that did Glenfarclas.</p><p>
<strong>Glen Deveron</strong> | H | 58.8 | 12 | 6.10 | [<i>&radic;
</i>-]:<br> OK, but not "redolent".</p><p>
<strong>Glenfarclas</strong> | H | 58.2 | 12 | 1.22 | [<i>&radic;
</i>-]:<br> A bit sharp, even allowing for the proof, and
not so flavorful as the 3.7 Bowmore, say, but clearly a reasonable
dram. (1.26: Not so memorable as anticipated.)</p><p>
<strong>Glenlossie</strong> | H | 59.5 | 14 | 46.2 | [<i>&radic;</i>&nbsp;
]:<br> Again, I think I like it. (Too much Joy of Club for
serious research.) And did like the 46.3 better than the 23.14 Macallan
at Interop90.</p><p>
<strong>Highland Park </strong>
| "I" | 59.5 | 11 | 4.8/.10 | [<i>&radic; </i>
(+)]:<br> Color was surprisingly light but taste was surprisingly
fine. (.10 less esteemed Over There in '91, but thought better of at
Interop91, so go know.)</p><p>
<strong>Imperial</strong> | H | 70.2(!) | 11 | 65.2 | [ - ]:<br>
Disappointingly sharp.</p><p>
<strong>Laphroaig</strong> | I | 58.9 | 13 |29.1 | [<i>&radic;</i>&nbsp;
]:<br> Very good for the age and proof; would be worth having on
hand.</p><p>
<strong>Linkwood</strong> | H | 57 | 14 | 39.7 (R) | [<i>&radic;
</i>+]:<br> For some reason, they aged this one 12 years in
a fino cask then 2 in an oloroso cask; for that reason, and the taste,
I brought it home in '91.</p><p>
<strong>Macallan</strong> | H | 64.7 | 9 | 24.13 | [ - ]:<br>
I got good nose but not enough flavor. (Probably too proofy.)</p><p>
<strong>Pittyvaich</strong> | H | 58.3 | 10 | 90.2 | [ - ]:<br>
Better nose than taste; bit thin; bit bitey.</p><p>
<strong>Port Ellen </strong>
| I | 60.1 | 18 | 43.10 | [<i>&radic;</i>&nbsp;
]:<br> More sweet than peat in the nose, but a very nice nose
nonetheless. Ditto, ditto the taste, neat. (And the peat comes out
after watering &amp; airing.)</p><p>
<strong>Pultney</strong> | H | 56.3 | 15 | 52.2 | [<i>&radic;
</i>&nbsp;/<i>&radic; </i> -]:<br> OK, but not
the sherry cask taste of the G&amp;M.</p><p>
<strong>St. Magdalene</strong> | L | OTS | OTS | 49.1 | [ -
]:<br> About what you'd expect from a Lowland, but it does grow
on one.</p><p>
<strong>Scapa</strong> | "I" | 62.4 | 10 | 17.3 | [<i>&radic;
</i>&nbsp;/<i>&radic; </i>
+]:<br> They say "a rich, full taste"; I say Amen.</p><p>
<strong>Tomatin</strong> | H | 57.4 | 12 | 11.4 | [ - ]:<br>
Not bad, but unexceptional. [Or even Unexceptionable, but....]<br>
