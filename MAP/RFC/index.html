<H1>Michael A. Padlipsky: A Bibliography</H1>
<P><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_A._Padlipsky">Michael Padlipsky</a> (MAP or Mike to his friends) is one of the Old Network Boys of the Internet formerly known
as the [D]ARPANet. (He also coined the phrase Old Network Boy to refer to his aging cronies.) 
This page is a partial bibliographic catalog of his writings including his <A HREF="#Book">Book</A>, the <A HREF="#teabag">original
papers</A> on which it was based, his other contributions
to <A HREF="#recent">networking </A>and operating systems history at Project MAC: MIT <A HREF="#Multics">Multics</A>,
Mike is <A HREF="#Quotable">quoted</A> both seriously and for humo[u]r. 
Mike was on the early Internet Web distinguished in part to the number of times his name appears in the anchor
of a(n) URL.

<H2><A NAME="Book"></A>The Book</H2>
<P>Mike Padlipsky's book <EM><B>The Elements of Networking Style</B> (&amp; Other Essays &amp; Animadversions of
the Art of Intercomputer Networking)</EM> (Originally published as Prentice Hall, ISBN 0-132-68129-3 hc, LC TK5105.5.P34
1985, <B>now back in print</B> <B>with the
BackInPrint program as <A HREF="https://isbn.nu/9780595088799">ISBN 0-595-08879-1</A>, $19.95</B>) is an elaboration of a number of <A HREF="#teabag">Internet
RFCs </A>(known informally as <A HREF="#teabag">The Teabag Papers</A>, below) and other old technical working papers in
MAP's inimitable &quot;constructive snottiness&quot; style. Decades ago, this book predicted that the free market
would choose TCP/IP over the ISO/OSI protocol set, in spite of global government &quot;standardization&quot; because
it was (a) available and (b) better (as measured by &quot;technicoaesthetic criticism&quot;). At the time, this
was considered heresy (and rather sarcastic heresy); TCP/IP was considered a staging mechanism for the rollout
of ISO-OSI-RM compliant protocols. The book was listed in the <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/19981203042050/http://www.savetz.com/booklist/obsolete.shtml">Unofficial
Internet Book List (1993-1997)</A> [archived].</P>
<P>If you like these RFC's, you will love the book, which includes cartoon illustrations (by David &quot;Omar&quot;
White and John Bean) and slogans &quot;suitable for framing&quot;. It is the result of making an MIT Humanities
major the systems programmer for <A HREF="#Multics">Multics for DARPANet</A> integration: a literary look at the
technological history of the information super-highway.</P>
<P>(The original of the title piece, Elements, is however not an RFC and thus you'll need to buy or borrow the
book to get the full flavor; the Prefatory Afterthoughts applied to the articles that are indexed here, the appendices
( &quot;Two introductions that were too good to waste&quot; which includes&quot;Standards: Threat or Menace?&quot;;
and &quot;The Arouet Papers&quot; which include &quot;Empirical Heresy Considered Threatening&quot;, &quot;ISORM
considered Threatening&quot; ,&quot;Standards Committeemen Considered Dangerous&quot; and &quot;An Alternative
encoding of '42' or The Ultimate Answer&quot;) and the rest of the package are worth it too. But then, I am partial:
I introduced Mike to the Editor who bought the concept for the Book.)

<P>A little known fact is that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie">Dennis Ritchie (1941-2011)</a>, co-progenitor of Unix, was Mike's (junior) officemate at MIT Project
Mac (Multics) until Bell Labs pulled out of the project (and thus forced Dennis and Ken to build his castrated system on
the oh-dark-hundred project in a skunkworks closet in New Jersey). Another better known but not as well known as
it might be is that both PR1ME Computer and Stratus were formed by ex-Multicians in the image of Multics, 
as were the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Series">NCSA Orange Book security requirements</a>. 
Most recent advances in operating systems were first developed for Multics but not immediately implemented elsewhere and forgotten, 
and later when found necessary, either reinvented the hardway, or cribbed from Multics. 
Other Multics trivia and not so trivial info can be found in 
<a href="https://alt.os.multics.narkive.com/">a newsgroup for Multicians</A> 
and the <A HREF="http://www.multicians.org/multicians.html#Padlipsky">Multicians.Org</A>
(mirror <A HREF="http://www.mit.edu:8001/afs/net/user/srz/www/multics.html">MIT Multics</A>) homepages. 
Mike had also contributed to MIT's TimeSharing projects (CTSS) before Multics on a <A HREF="http://www.multicians.org/%7Ethvv/%7Ethvv/7094.html">7094</A>
(mirrored <A HREF="http://www.best.com/~thvv/7094.html">best</A>, <A HREF="http://www.lilli.com/7094.html">lilli</A>).
Mike contributed to the <A HREF="http://www.city.ac.uk/~sh392/multics/mspm-ba-1.html">Multics Programmers Manual</A>.</P>

(Further trivia: The C in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatible_Time-Sharing_System">CTSS</a> stands for Compatible 
&mdash; interactive time-sharing being compatible with co-hosted batch processing, an advantage for research <i>computation</i>, but not for programming <i>research</i> &mdash; 
against which the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incompatible_Timesharing_System">LCS ITS</a> system's I for <i>Incompatible</i> was a reaction and parody. 
Unix the castrated or singular form of Multics was not the first reactionary pun!)

<p>The surviving builders of the (D)ARPAnet &amp; Internet and the historians who study them hang out on the
<a href="http://www.postel.org/internet-history/index.html">Internet History mailing list</a> care of the <a href="http://www.postel.org">Postel Center</a> at SRI, which is 
named in memory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Postel">Jon Postel (1943-1998)</a>, the RFC Editor, to whom Mike rededicated the reprint of <a href="#Book">The Book</a>.

	<P>As M. A. Padlipsky has pointed out in criticism of other aspects of ISO negotiation, the national PTT organizations

	an overwhelming voice in drowning out the protests of computer types who would like to be able to use arbitrary
	array addresses to access any part of a text file without having to read it through from the beginning every time
	to make sure that the array index doesn't just happen to land in the middle of a multiple octet sequence.

I don't think that's fair, in his day, seating on the NWG's was limited to working systems programs, no marketing
