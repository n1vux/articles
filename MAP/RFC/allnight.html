      <p>Despite my stated views
on the futility of "doing" technohistory,
I can scarcely find it in what's left of my heart to decline Peter
Salus's invitation to take a turn in his Lest They Forget/Be Forgotten
series, especially since I've been itching for at least a couple of
years to have an excuse to dispute various selfserving claims of
Fathers of this and Inventors of that now that the 'Net is the darling
of the mediaocrities.
And the best place to start is almost certainly with a restatement of
why
I think technohistory can't be done (lifted from <em>The
Elements of
Networking Style and Other Essays and Animadversions on the Art of
Intercomputer Networking</em>, new
ISBN 0-595-08879-1, presumably available via backinprint.com by the
time you read this -- which I can now do without any fear of the
original
publisher, since the copyright reverted to me when They declared The
Book out of print and
destroyed the remaining inventory without keeping Their promise to
inform me in
advance if They were ever going to do so ... which didn't surprise me,
since I'd long had proof
They'd only been paying me royalties on every <em>other</em>
copy They sold all the long):</p>


      

      
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Around [20, by now]
years
ago I ran into an Old Network Boy friend (Gary Grossman,
actually) I hadn't seen for a while. We got to reminiscing about the
good old days
five or so years previously on the "New" Telnet [...] working group and
I said, "You
know, I always liked your IAC trick." ( [...] a fairly important
second-order mechanism
of the ARPANET'S second-pass Virtual terminal protocol.) "Wait a
minute," he replied,
"IAC was one of <em>yours</em>
." &nbsp;&nbsp;[Page 24, if you're
curious about the fuller context.] </p>


      
      <p> He was right, by the way.
The neat ideas zipped around the design meetings at a great rate of
speed (and volume, usually; in both senses of the term). Even before we
all hit at best
EarlyMiddleage (and I fear I crossed over into MiddleMiddleage last
May; most of the
others still have a few years to go, though, damn them) we didn't
really remember who'd
come up with which neat notion. Indeed, over at least a 22-year period
before the
untimely and intensely lamented death of Jon Postel, he and I had
frequent
conversations trying to reconstruct the origins of a number of neat
notions and we almost never
succeeded, even on many of the ones I was fairly sure had been his
(which, in fact,
was most of them). And before the 'Net became big business, it was
fairly easy for
us to shrug it off; things had worked out, and what did it matter
whether he, or I, or
Gary, or even one of the BBN guys -- who always seemed to get to write
the histories
and hence always seemed to have claimed to have invented everything,
anyway, perhaps
because BBN was the only "for-profit" to furnish key members of the
original Network
Working Group -- had actually been the first to enunciate an idea that
was almost always
implicit in the discussion to begin with? </p>


      
      <p>Now, however, there seems
to be at least some celebrity value attached to
that sort of thing, if not indeed some financial value. There might
even just
possibly be a minute amount of value to be attached to "historical
accuracy",
or "intellectual integrity", or some other hopelessly pre-GenX
abstraction, but it
would doubtless be a tactical error to espouse that sort of thing.
Besides, as indicated, some of the
current claims stick in my craw, and Peter did ask me to "write
something" and didn't get at all specific as to what, so... </p>


      
      <p>Let's start with the one
I'm in fact quite certain I was the inventor of,
especially because I can't recall which of the BBN guys is claiming it
and so I can
put off the delicate question of whether I want to name names for a
while longer:
"anonymous login". I remember pretty clearly, despite being somewhat
unsure as to who the other person in the conversation was (Dirk,
maybe?), being at SRI for some sort of
meeting sometime around 1973 and being told that "the NIC" (or at least
Jake [=Elizabeth Feinler - PHS]) was worried about this idea to put the
RFCs on-line, because they'd have to
establish all sorts of accounts so people could FTP them. "That's
easy," I said, "just use my NETML trick." By which I meant, and went on
to explain, that just as I'd had to propound a
conventional universal "dummy" id and password so that netmail
(as we'd called it when we were inventing it, but I'll get to that soon
enough) could work via FTP without causing grave harm to the security
(and accounting) mechanisms of at least some of the Hosts (mainly
Multics, of course, since I was the Multics Network Technical Liaison
at the time), all the NIC needed to do was establish a single, known
account everybody
could use to slurp the RFC's from. "'guest' would be a perfectly fine
id,"
I went on, "and the password should be 'anonymous', since we'd gain
some measure of
security in that people'd have to know how to spell it and of course
not everybody does." Or
words very close to that, and to exactly that effect, even if I
actually gave the id and
password values in the reverse order. [The NETML trick was enunciated
in RFC 491,
in case you care -- and in case it ever gets scanned in so you can
care. -- MAP] </p>


      
      <p>Now, EarlyMiddleAgedMemory (EMAM) being what it was, and
MiddleMiddleAgedMemory (MMAM) being what it is, naturally I don't
recall whether I read
that one of the
BBN guys was laying claim to "anonymous login" the other year or saw it
on
one of those overly-coy little "courses" PBS (the P is for Pious,
I like to observe) has taken to showing,
before I decided they annoyed me so much I won't watch any more. (Even
if
I were
on one? Irrelevant question. I didn't get rich, nor did I get my claims
to've invented things into "the literature" early enough, because
my company didn't get commissioned
to write the "First 10 Years" report and wind up being visited
first by the Internet
history book writers.) But I submit that anybody who knows me knows
that
the crack about security <em>has
to</em>
be one of mine, and MMAM insists that whoever was laying the claim gave
it
as his
own, which makes me suspect that the charitable explanation of parallel
evolution
doesn't apply and it was either <em>his</em>
EMAM in play or just plain theft of intellectual property. Fortunately,
anonymous
login isn't really anything to be proud of -- especially since it was
exploited for
a famous security breach when it was misimplemented on a certain
highly-popular Host
type -- so I can rise above. </p>


      
      <p><b>Digression
on Internet History Books</b> </p>


      
      <p>I'm not ready to name
names yet, but I do want to offer a thought or two
about this
business of who gets talked to first by the historians. The authors of
a
couple
of Internet history books did, one way or another, happen to get in
touch
with me
during their "research" phases. Both had been in touch with BBN
first. One of the authors
did do me the courtesy of not buying the BBN version of the anonymous
login
story
when the topic came up during our e-conversations. The other author
apparently "bought
into" the BBN version of just about everything (I've been warned by
several friends not
to read the book, in deference to my G.I. Woe), and on happening to
meet me
a couple
of years after cancelling out on a scheduled interview, said "You
don't look at all
like what I'd expected" and then wandered away, without even letting
me explain why
my reply had been, "You mean because I'm not 7 feet tall?".
Maybe I'm wrong, but
the only explanation I could come up with was that the BBN guys had
described me
with about the same degree of objectivity as Shakespeare had applied to
Richard III, and the
cognitive dissonance -- is embarrassment over having been duped too
much to
hope
for? probably -- was more than could be dealt with. </p>


      
      <p>There might be some other
reason for the apparent personal slight, and I'm
taking
care not to identify the author in question, but the fact still remains
that enormous
bias can be introduced into all history books, much less technohistory
ones, based
on whom the authors talk, or refer, to first ... and whom they find
agreeable, of course.
(Hey, at least the first author kinda liked me.) </p>


      
      <p>(By the way, the "7 feet
tall" crack came from the time I once
got a telephone call
at work from a programmer who worked for Univac who'd been astute
enough to
have
figured out that I was the right person to ask about the design intent
of
the Telnet
Protocol, and when it came out in the course of the conversation that
I'm
not above average
height she said, quite unsarcastically I believe, "But you write as if
you're seven
feet tall!") </p>


      
      <p><b>Back
to the Main Thread, Such as it Is</b> </p>


      
      <p>OK, here goes. It'd be
not only disingenuous but downright cowardly not to
name a
couple of names. So first off, I don't believe Ray Tomlinson invented
"e-mail".
And not because of the quibble that we called it netmail originally,
though that
does offer an excuse to observe that I personally find the term
"e-mail" awfully cutesy, and
references to "sending an e-mail" syntactic slime. Nor because
of the semi-quibble
that "mail" had been around intra-Host on several of the Host
operating systems since
well before anybody realized they were Hosts, though that one has a
great
deal of abstract
"historical" appeal. No, it's because I have a completely clear
memory that Ray
wasn't even at the FTP meeting where we decided to add mail to the
protocol. Granted,
one of the BBN guys mentioned that he'd done a TENEX to TENEX mail hack
already, and
that he'd used the "@" between id and host name for the
addresses, but that was after
somebody had said, "Hey, why don't we send mail via FTP?" <em>And
for all I know, that
somebody might have been me</em>.
(Or "been I", I imagine ... if you're a fanatic Syntactic Puritan.) I'm
not saying
it was, but I don't <em>know</em>
it wasn't. What I am sure of is that I was one of the strongest
proponents of doing
it, whoever broached the idea, and that <em>I
could have vetoed the
famous "@", but didn't</em>. </p>


      
      <p>Vetoed it? Huh? Well, it
takes a little, um, er, history to explain that
one. When
the "TIP" (or Terminal IMP, the ancestral terminal support
machine, and at least
weakly arguably the grandfather of the "ISP") was introduced --
and MMAM assures
me EMAM had long believed it was at the 1971 Network Working Group
meeting
in Atlantic City,
though both could be wrong, as usual -- the BBN guys announced, with
grins,
that
the "intercept character" was going to be the "at-sign"
and all looked at me. The
reason was that on Multics, the at-sign was the reserved line-delete
character. I thought
about it for a second or two (being much younger and quicker of wit
then)
and said
something very much along the lines of, "I guess. After all,
everybody hits it a
few times to be sure it takes, and you tell me doubling it will let it
get
through, so it
shouldn't be that hard to remember that if we're TIPping to Multics we
need
to hit
it an odd number of times when we want it intercepted but an even
number of
times
when we want Multics to get it." And with that in mind, since in
those days we tended, or
pretended, to subscribe to the "all researchers together" myth, I
had one coming,
and could have insisted that it was too inconvenient for Multics users
to
have to
type \@ when sending netmail, so let's pick another character. Or even
use
the more Multicsy
syntax of "-at". But since it was the <em>at</em>
sign -- even though I could swear it was called the "commercial at
sign"
in my high
school typing class, just to pick a nit now that I might well have
picked
then, too
- and since I <em>am</em>
a Semantic Puritan, I couldn't bring myself to argue that it wasn't
appropriate,
and let it pass. </p>


      
      <p>So when it comes to who
invented e-, or net-, mail, I submit: that as usual
it was
a group thing; that Ray wasn't at the meeting where it became part of
the
'Net, although,
granted, he was, as far as I know, the first person to send mail from
one
computer
to another over a network, even though they were like computers, which
isn't particularly
interesting or challenging even if the world's most over-"capped"
corporation can't
seem to do consistently better than that these days, and for all I know
somebody
at the National Physical Laboratory in England had already done at
least
the same,
and maybe even used unlike operating systems (the Brits turn out to
have
better claims
to've invented a surprising number of things, I've noticed over the
years,
but apparently the historians' travel budgets are never adequate...) --
and
he did have the insight
to realize that "@" is commonly pronounced "at", of
course; and that if I really
wanted to I could always pretend to be sure I'd been the one to propose
doing mail
via FTP at the meeting and I don't think anybody who was there and who
is
intellectually
honest could gainsay me, but I don't really want to because I'm simply <em>not</em>
sure who proposed it. I am, however, completely sure that it was
implicit
in what we were doing, so in a fairly real sense we all invented it. </p>


      
      <p>One other thing about
mail: Realize that FTP-based mail required the other
Host to
be up at the time (though people did come up with queuers for delayed
sending if
it wasn't), and it's arguable that what made "e-mail" really take
off was when the
model was changed so that that was no longer the case. The change came
with SMTP. Jon was,
of course, the author of that protocol, and knowing him he probably was
the
one who
proposed it at the meeting, but I wasn't at the meeting so I don't
know,
but I'm
perfectly content to assert that his claim to inventing "e-mail"
is as good as anybody's. </p>


      
      <p><b>"It's
a Wise Child that Knows Its Own Father"</b> </p>


      
      <p>Or is it "It's a wise
father that knows his own child"? (Or, in
PC -- for Philologically
Corrupt -- contempobabble: It's a wise child that knows their own
father,
maybe.
Let's hope it wouldn't have to be their own parent in PCorruption of
the
first version, anyway, which MMAM does think is the original: the use
of
"their" with a singular
antecedent to avoid choosing between "him", "her", or
"him or her" is nauseating
enough; if They insist on destroying the sense by ignoring that
motherhood
is a matter
of fact, fatherhood is the one that's a matter of conjecture, They're
not
even worth
trying to talk to.) Anyway, let's get to this "Father of the
Internet" crap. </p>


      
      <p>Normally, I'd say "In my
humble but dogmatic opinion", but I
don't want to be misunderstood. <em>In my considered opinion</em>,
Len Kleinrock's claim to be the father of the Internet is ... no, don't
get "personal",
make it, I know: unfounded. And/or lacking in merit. And/or utterly
unfounded.
And/or utterly lacking in merit. And/or ... get the picture? </p>


      
      <p>Now, between the word
count Peter asked me to live with and the fact that
my carpal
tunnels are on the brink of cave-in after some 37 years of
"keyboarding", I'm not
going to go into much detail as to why I think a number of people's
claims
for that
fundamentally meaningless but emotively compelling title are better
than
Len's, though I'll
touch on some of them briefly. And perhaps surprise you by not
including
myself
among them. But for Clio's sake, if she was the Muse of History, or for
x's sake
assuming Peter will fill in the x for me [Clio is correct. - PHS], all
Len was was the faculty guy who got the grant from ARPA to do the
Network Measurement Center, where the first IMP happened to be
installed. That doesn't even make him the father of the ARPANET, which <em>ISN'T</em>
the Internet, if you're not a mediaocrity and care something about
technical accuracy
as opposed to "selling papers". Granted, three people who worked
for him have good
claims to the title -- far, far better claims, imhbdo -- but that would
at
best let
him claim to be the grandfather, or more accurately great-grandfather,
not
the father.
And depending upon how you define "the Internet", it's eminently
arguable that their
claims aren't as good as those of three other guys, whose efforts led
to
Len's getting the grant. (There's a fourth guy who worked at the NMC,
who's still a good friend,
whose claims to netpaternity are no better than my own non-existent
ones,
but he
was also an important "player" in the early days and he's so
incensed by Len's claim
that in his honor I'm spending more time, and subjecting my wrists and
fingers to more
wear and tear, on this point than I might otherwise have done. However,
the "all
Len was" point just made is, at some level, sufficient refutation.) </p>


      
      <p>By the way, I left out
one strikingly negative (imhbdo) contribution Ray
made in order
not to get "personal", and I'm leaving out two (ditto) Len made
for the same reason;
but I'm not anywhere near noble enough not to mention that I'm doing
so.
But wait:
I've belatedly realized that I also left out an amusingly discreditable
sidelight
on the second "history book's" author, so I fear nobility has nothing at all to do with
it,
it's just
that I seem to be getting soft, in my MMA. Not soft enough, after due
deliberation,
to omit mention of one other craw-sticker, though, namely the ...
interesting aspect of
the BBN "corporate culture" which led the nominal author of the "New"
Telnet RFC
to effusively acknowledge the assistance of his BBN colleagues in the
document and
totally ignore the fact that not only had I edited it extensively but
around a quarter of
the actual words printed were mine. (Not that I choose to offer him the
publicity
of mentioning his name, of course, but he's also the one who declined
to
co-sign
my Host-Front End Protocol RFC despite the fact that 20some others in
the
NWG did and he'd privately
told me he agreed with it, on the stated grounds that "it wouldn't be
good
for the
company" to admit publicly to being for something that would make more
work
for the IMP -- which tells us some more about the corporate culture,
I'd
say. Indeed, MMAM
belatedly assures me that for a number of years I was quite fond of
saying
that we'd
done the 'Net despite BBN, not because of it, but I'm already over the
word-count
as I add this and probably couldn't remember enough of the points on
which
that was based
anyway, so will let it go at that.) </p>


      
      <p>"Historically speaking",
let's touch on the three without whom
Len wouldn't have gotten
his grant in the first place: J.C.R. Licklider, Bob Taylor, and Larry
Roberts. Lick
is usually credited with having had the germ of the idea to network
computers, and
I liked him so much personally I can't be objective: if there must be a
"the" Father
of the 'Net to satisfy the mediaocrities, then as They seem to
non-define
the 'Net,
Lick's the one. Period. Bob Taylor, whom I didn't know personally but
as
his wife
happened to tell me at a party at Bob Metcalfe's apartment in 1978 did
pick
up the torch
from Lick and hired Larry Roberts to run with it, has a very good claim
too. (Speaking
of Metcalfe, a non-PBS show I made the mistake of watching recently
semidemihinted
that he, as the acknowledged "father" of Ethernet, might have
some claim to the Internet
title as well. I don't think he admitted the soft impeachment, as it
were,
but just
for the record the Internet wasn't built to link together <em>only</em>
Ethernets, but in fact various and sundry comm subnet
"technologies", nor did Bob
have anything to do with developing IP, as I recall, so that's a
non-starter.) And
Larry was introduced at the '71 NWG meeting with the phrase "And now a
word from
Our Sponsor", so to those of us doing the work of building the
ARPANET, Larry's claim feels
pretty good, too -- especially to those of you who weren't fortunate
enough
to've
worked in the same building as Lick for what, five or six years, one or
two
of which
he was your boss's boss's boss. </p>


      
      <p>Nor, turning to the three
who originally worked at the NMC, should we
overlook the
person who was chairing the meeting and introducing Larry: Steve
Crocker.
Steve
was hired by the ARPA office to run the Network Working Group, and
deserves
full
credit for getting things going w/r/t the 'Net, even unto writing RFC
#1.
I don't feel at all
filial about his role, but his claim still strikes me as better than
Len's.
Then
there's Vint Cerf's role. He, too, started at the NMC and went on to
the
ARPA office.
The difference is that if you define the Internet at all strictly,
Vint's
participation
in the "invention" of TCP/IP coupled with his role in
coordinating the contracts
and contractors who implemented the protocol suite makes me feel that
if he
chose
to say "I was the Father of the Internet" on his "web
site" I might flinch a bit but I certainly
wouldn't sneer. Finally, we shouldn't overlook Jon Postel, the way
almost
everybody
did until we lost him and then people suddenly noticed how important,
how
central, how vital his participation had been all the long. He was the
only one of the Old
Network Boys whose views I took with fewer grains of salt than I took
my
own, of
course, but the real point is that almost all the protocol RFC's were
under
his authorship, and not because he was that slick a writer. It's
because
he understood how the
protocols had to work better than any of us, usually because the ideas
they
embodied
were his, even when he wouldn't acknowledge that, after the fact. </p>


      
      <p>At the risk of getting a
bit sloppy here, and almost certainly commiting a
metaphor
that should have been blocked, I simply can't resist observing that
it's
not particularly
interesting who the "father" of the Internet was, because what
really matters is
who its "mother" was, in the sense of whose <em>labor</em>
gave it birth. And if you need me to spell the rest of it out for you,
I
assume you wouldn't understand it anyway... </p>


      
      <p>Come to think of it,
though, if that's all a bit too equivocal for you,
maybe we should
remember our <em>Time Enough for
Love</em> (and if you haven't read
everything Heinlein wrote at least twice, it's your loss)
and consider how the fleshly version of the computer "Minerva" came to
be:
a chromosome
pair from Justin Foote for math, a chromosome pair from Lazarus Long
presumably for
longevity, and so on. So maybe the Internet wasn't fathered or mothered
but rather
created out of Lick's genes for inspiration and, I dunno, charm, and
Jon's
genes
for call it technical intuition or brilliance and maybe composure, or
whatever it
was that enabled him to forge consensus among all us prima donnas, and
Vint's gene for, I suppose,
leadership, and ... so on. (Gee, maybe that way even I'd get a piece of
the action
myself, since I'd like to think that my gene for, what, righteous
indignation? Constructive Snottiness? belongs in the mix, too, for
being
willing to take up the cudgels
in public against the ISORMite idiocy -- a/k/a "OSI" for those who
haven't
read The
Book -- probably did help, <em>some</em>.) </p>

Conclusion Bear in Memory"</b> </p>


      
      <p>Keep the password in your
mind.... Oops, wrong song (but a wonderful one;
do searchengineer
it if you don't know it -- provided anybody's bothered to webulate it,
of
course).
No, what to keep in mind is that from my point of view it's all rather
moot, when you get right down to it: </p>


      
      <p>Jon's been taken from us,
after all, so sticking up for his "rights" is
merely an exercise in sentimentality -- though not, one hopes,
futility. (And I say
"taken from us" advisedly, though this isn't the time or place to go
into why
since I'm being careful not to risk any libel suits by not being
personally
insulting, even to those who have insulted me -- nor am I afraid of the
original publisher, since Truth
is the classically best defense against libel charges if They were
stupid enough
to take me on even though I haven't even mentioned 'Em by name -- but
couldn't
possibly avoid it if I got started on the topic of whom I view as the
villain of Jon's last
years.) </p>


      
      <p>And I, after all, went
into de facto retirement years ago, when I left the
second job in a row over not being allowed to smoke in my own office,
so <em>I've</em>
got nothing to gain from winning any technopaternity suits. (Not even
the
mild egoboo of a cameo on one of the tellyjoke shows, since I'd insist
on approval of
the final cut lest I be accorded the same gratuitously snotty treatment
Ted Nelson --
eminently arguably the "Father of the Web", by the way -- was, and
clearly
that'd never be granted.) Unless ... gee, what if The Book reprint'd be
a bestseller if it
were advertised as being by the Father of ...? Nah, anybody who read it
would
still need to be able to deal with real sentences, and there are far
too few of us
left. </p>


      
      <p>So unless some or all of
the over-"capped" companies that owe
their existence to us (cisco, Network Solutions, and, save the mark,
AOL come immediately to
mind) were to decide to give chunks of stock to the Fathers of this and
Inventors of
that in appreciation, all that's at stake is another one of those
hopelessly
pre-GenX abstractions: "for the record". (Actually, what I think would
be far more
seemly would be to award, say, 1,000, but even a couple of hundred
would be nice, shares per RFC to
the authors of all substantive [i.e., non-repetitive, in the sense of
the
monthly reports on Host traffic or even the every-hundred indexes]
RFC's with numbers under
1000 [inspired by the time Interop gave out t-shirts to the authors of
the first thousand
RFCs, even if they only allowed us to pick one RFC number to have
printed on it,
which led some of us to agonize a lot]. That'd be nice. And Jon's
lion's share of the
shares could go to funding the Old Programmers Home, as we discussed
when I first had
idea ... the day I heard Netscape's stock was over 150, to which I'd
also will the
proceeds of my own 20some lots. Of course, with my usual luck if they
did do it the
market'd make October of '29 look like a mere blip before I could
convert to
tax-frees anyway, so it's all still moot, isn't it.) </p>


      
      <p>Meanwhile, what price
"resource sharing"? The Bandwidth Bandits reign,
even turning off "autoload images" doesn't spare one from slithering
signs,
everybody's committed to being HTML-trendy, "browsers" are bigger than
operating systems need to
be, and the main difference between "the Web" and the Sunday paper is
that the
p-ads can be used for wrapping fish... </p>


      
      <p>Let at least one
tradition be upheld, though: we conclude with the usual </p>
