<p>Michael A Padlipsky was born in NJ in 1939, grew up and attended school in Westminster, LA County, California, graduated from MIT, attended BU grad school, and worked as a systems programer/architect on</p>

</ul>
<p>During his working life, he lived in Cambridge MA, the DC area, Arlington MA, and finally returned to his boyhood bungalo in LA County, where he retired.</p>
<p>Mike died in 2011 after a long illness; the irony of the &quot;No Smoking — Oxygen in Use&quot; sign on his door was jarring. He was a loving &quot;official honorary uncle&quot; to the children of several classmates who were likewise only-children, who'd formed just such a pact. He was also survived by a late-life renewed-romance remote fiancée, who hosted our Wake.</p>
<h2 id="first-thesis-on-scifi-as-litcrit">?First? Thesis on SciFi as LitCrit</h2>
<p>MIT graciously returned, in 2003, copyright to M.A.P.'s 1960 Bachelor's Thesis, <em>More than Pulp(?): Science Fiction and the Problem of Literary Merit</em>.</p>
<p>This was for 35 years presumed to be the first academic thesis on SciFi as LitCrit, but no, writer and academic James E Gunn (1923-2020) did his 1951 M.A. thesis first. (Had the Internet been available in 1960, a literature search would have found it, or at least the 1958 reference to it.) Likely still the earliest Bachelors Thesis, and it centers Literary Merit right in the title.</p>

<p>Mike was a Scotch blogger before there was a Web to have WebLogs on - by medium of NetMail (as they called it when they were inventing it, as he'd say) and file transfer of text files.</p>
<p>His primary quest was to find another bottle of the semi-mythical A&amp;N MOHM Glen Grant 14, and secondarily, to determine what was the second-best single-malt after that, which resulted in The Research Notes.</p>

<p>MAP was one of the Old Network Boys (as he said), member of the Network Working Group &amp; Internet Research Group, author of multiple ARPAnet/Internet RFCs and white papers on computer Networking, and recast some of them into a book, <strong>The Elements of Networking Style</strong>. And also some delicious &quot;constructively snotty&quot; criticism of matters of &quot;technicoaesthetics&quot; in networking.</p>
