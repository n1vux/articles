## Biographical.

![Michael A Padlipsky (1939-2011)](./RFC/imgs/image002.jpg)

Michael A Padlipsky was born in NJ in 1939, grew up and attended school in Westminster, LA County, California, attended MIT, and worked as a systems programer/architect on 

* [SAGE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAGE_(computer)), 
* [MIT Project MAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Computer_Science_and_Artificial_Intelligence_Laboratory#Project_MAC) CTTS &amp; MULTICS,
* [(D)ARPAnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET) NWG, [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet) [IETF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force), & [MILnet+DDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MILNET), specializing in Protocols (FTP,HFEP,TCP/IP).

During his working life, he lived in Cambridge MA, the DC area, Arlington MA, and finally returned to his boyhood bungalo in LA County, where he retired.

Mike died in 2011 after a long illness; the irony of the &quot;No Smoking &mdash; Oxygen in Use&quot; sign on his door was jarring. He was a loving &quot;official honorary uncle&quot; to the children of several classmates who were likewise only-children, who'd formed just such a pact. He was also survived by a late-life renewed-romance remote fiance&eacute;, who hosted our Wake.

## ?First? Thesis on SciFi as LitCrit

MIT graciously returned, in 2003, copyright to M.A.P.'s 1960 Bachelor's Thesis, 
*More than Pulp(?): Science Fiction and the Problem of Literary Merit*.

This was for 35 years presumed to be the first academic thesis on SciFi as LitCrit, but no, writer and academic James E Gunn (1923-2020) did his 1951 M.A. thesis first. (Had the Internet been available in 1960, a literature search would have found it, or at least the 1958 reference to it.) Likely still the earliest Bachelors Thesis, and it centers Literary Merit right in the title.

## the Scotch proto-Blogger

Mike was a Scotch blogger before there was a Web to have WebLogs on - by medium of NetMail (as they called it when they were inventing it, as he'd say) and file transfer of text files.

His primary quest was to find another bottle of the semi-mythical A&N MOHM Glen Grant 14, and secondarily, to determine what was the second-best single-malt after that, which resulted in The Research Notes.

## Technical Contributions in Internetworking

MAP was one of the Old Network Boys (as he said), member of the Network Working Group, author of multiple  ARPAnet/Internet RFCs and white papers on computer Networking, and recast some of them into a book, **The Elements of Networking Style**.
