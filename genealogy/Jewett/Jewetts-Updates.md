# Jewett Ancestors not previously listed

This page reports additional Descendants (non-living only) of [_Jewetts of America_](https://archive.org/search?query=%22Jewetts+of+America%22) ([OpenLibrary](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL7001732M/History_and_genealogy_of_the_Jewetts_of_America#editions-list)) volumes 1 & 2 persons in my own ancestry. (_Hereafter referred to as JoA and J#._)

As far as I know (AFAIK), none of the un-numbered persons listed here were in the Newsletters or Annuals. (If [JoA society](https://www.jewett.org/) newsletter editor would like this reformatted for newsletter, contact me on FB or email!)

Siblings and/or parents of two last-numbered ancestors here are mentioned in Newsletter/Quarterly articles, but not the last-numbered ancestor nor first un-numbered, as noted below at [J#7151 & J#9180 + J#9181](#j7151-david-nathaniel-jewett), [J#217 & J#645](217-hannah-jewett), _q.v._


I've made my own [index of Vols 3 & 4 clusters](joa-v3+4-clusters.html), and i have verified none of those newly numbered clusters match these un-numbered lines. Though several are adjacent: 

* J#17 Hannnah, aunt & m. cousin, sibling of J#15 Jeremiah [iii:1], which latter is in my J#217 Hannah and J#7151 David N lines; 
* J#22 Joseph, Step-father, and half-sibling of ancestor J#15 so Â½uncle [iii:14], ditto;
* J#63 Jonathan, uncle, bro. of J#64 Aquila [iii:26], which latter is in my J#4624 Florence, J#1341 Sarah  lines; 
* J#645 James, Uncle, bro. of J#646 Moses, which latter is in my J#7151 David N line; James died of woulds at seige of Louisburg, where many ancestors fought, some died [iii:154]; 
* J#2735 Moses, uncle, as bro. of J#2736 Joseph [iv:878], which latter is in my J#7151 David N line.)

* This view shows connection of **Edward^1** to your humble reporter, who would appear two lines below the bottom margin. This view is omitting non-Jewett in-laws as well as all living persons. Produced in the [GRAMPS desktop program](https://gramps-project.org/blog/).
* Red &#x1f534; on marriage denotes consanguineous marriage; sometimes not Jewett! Text below should indicate degree of cousinship.
* On Person: red &#x1f534; is medical doctor; <span style="background-color:cyan">sky blue</span> is immigrant; orange &#x1F7E0; is unsure connection; purples &#x1f7ea; are clergy or deacon; <span style="background-color:  #9bdd47">lt.green</span> is proprietor; dk.brown &#x1F7EB; is slave-holder; medium blue &#x1F7E6; is soldier or militia; <span style="background-color:tan">tan</span> is Mayflower descent line carrier. (These colors are my own mnemonic choices for my selection of filterable "tags" on people and families.)

Note: Numbers below that are prefixed with **J#** are [_Jewetts of America_](https://archive.org/search?query=%22Jewetts+of+America%22) numbers from those books, which are referred to as **JoA**. Other family descendency ids provided as cross-reference are identified when used.
