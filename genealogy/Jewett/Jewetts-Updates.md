# Jewett Ancestors not previously listed

This page reports my tangled Jewett pedigree, noting additional Descendants (non-living only) of [_Jewetts of America_](https://archive.org/search?query=%22Jewetts+of+America%22) ([OpenLibrary](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL7001732M/History_and_genealogy_of_the_Jewetts_of_America#editions-list)) volumes 1 & 2 persons therein. (_Hereafter referred to as JoA and J#._)

As far as I know (AFAIK), none of the un-numbered persons listed here were in the Newsletters, Quarterly, or Annual publications of the society. (_If [JoA society](https://www.jewett.org/) newsletter editor would like this reformatted for newsletter, i would consider - and will also share further details with the Historian._)

Siblings and/or parents of two last-numbered ancestors here are mentioned in Newsletter/Quarterly articles, but not the last-numbered ancestor nor first un-numbered, as noted below at [J#7151 & J#9180 + J#9181](#j7151-david-nathaniel-jewett), [J#217 & J#645](217-hannah-jewett), _q.v._


I've made my own [index of Vols 3 & 4 clusters](joa-v3+4-clusters.html), and i have verified none of those newly numbered clusters match these un-numbered lines. Though several are adjacent: 

* J#17 Hannnah, aunt & m. cousin, sibling of J#15 Jeremiah [iii:1], which latter is in my J#217 Hannah and J#7151 David N lines; 
* J#22 Joseph, Step-father, and half-sibling of ancestor J#15 so ½uncle [iii:14], ditto;
* J#63 Jonathan, uncle, bro. of J#64 Aquila [iii:26], which latter is in my J#4624 Florence, J#1341 Sarah  lines; 
* J#645 James, Uncle, bro. of J#646 Moses, which latter is in my J#7151 David N line; James died of woulds at seige of Louisburg, where many ancestors fought, some died [iii:154]; 
* J#2735 Moses, uncle, as bro. of J#2736 Joseph [iv:878], which latter is in my J#7151 David N line.)

Key:

* This view shows connection of  &#x2460; **J#1 Edward** to your humble reporter, who would appear two lines below the bottom margin. 
* This view is omitting non-Jewett in-laws as well as all living persons. Produced in the [GRAMPS desktop program](https://gramps-project.org/blog/).
* On Marriage: Red &#x1f534; denotes consanguineous marriage; often but not always Jewett! Text below should indicate degree of cousinship.
* On Person: red &#x1f534; is medical doctor; <span style="background-color:cyan">sky blue</span> is immigrant; orange &#x1F7E0; is unsure connection; purples &#x1f7ea; are clergy or deacon/elder; <span style="background-color:  #9bdd47">lt.green</span> is proprietor; dk.brown &#x1F7EB; is slave-holder; medium blue &#x1F7E6; is soldier or militia, if paired with <span style="background-color: #75507B; color: #FFFFFF">deep purple</span>, Revolutionary service; <span style="background-color:tan">tan</span> is Mayflower descent line carrier (marked &#x1F4AE; in text below).  Black &#x25A0; marks end of line on old wall fan-chart, (or killed/executed/witch, but not on _this_ chart).  (_These colors are my own mnemonic choices for my selection of filterable "tags" on people and families in GRAMPS._)
* One line from my parents' fan-chart, J#6 Ezekiel to J#817 Lydia, I think is busted, and appears struck-out with translucent gray above, and is discussed below [re J#587 Deac. Noah Jewett’s wife Lydia](#re-j587-deac.-noah-jewetts-wife-lydia).

Note: Numbers below that are prefixed with **J#** are [_Jewetts of America_](https://archive.org/search?query=%22Jewetts+of+America%22) numbers from those books, which are referred to as **JoA**. Other family descendency ids provided as cross-reference are identified when used and listed in [Bibliography](#bibliography-for-cross-reference-numbers). Descent Generation numbers (given as superscripts^9^ in other family genealogies) are shown in circles &#x2468; .

As noted above, there is a web genealogy with a Jewett line from this Jeremiah 
to the wife of [**J#7151 David Jewett** ](#j7151-david-nathaniel-jewett) q.v.

&#x26A0; **WARNING:** _I have **not verified** this line found on the web myself, yet. The connections between Pearson and Carleton are quite plausible as the families were professionally connected in construction and operation of mills in both Essex Co and Lincoln Co. Exactly which Carl(e)ton is father of which of the consanguineous Carleton-Carleton match is recorded differently some places; TBD! Descent is supposedly from Jeremiah's dau. Lois thusly:_

* &#x2466; Lois Pearson m. Thomas **Carleton**
	- &#x2467; Jeremeiah Carleton m. Sally Carleton (1st Cousins)
		- &#x2468; Mary Jane Carlton m. Michael **Shea**
			- &#x2469; Emma Mary Shea, m. &#x2469; [**J#7151 David Jewett** ](#j7151-david-nathaniel-jewett) 

**If** _this Pearson-Carelton line is correct, Emma M Shea and David N Jewett are 5th cousins from_ &#x2463; **J#69 Jeremiah Jewett**.

##  &#x2465; re J#587 Deac. Noah Jewett's wife Lydia

`(Stephen^198, Aquila^64, Joseph^11, Maximilian^3, Edward^1),`

J#587 ***Deacon Noah Jewett***'s wife Lydia Boynton (Jewett) ***might*** have been &#x2466; ~~J#817 Lydia Boynton~~, 
daughter of &#x2465; J#325 Lydia Jewett (Boynton), daughter of &#x2464; J#117  Samuel Jewett (sr) (who died in Hollis N.H.) 
and thus would have been sister of &#x2466; J#816 Samuel Boynton (jr);
and if so ~~this would have been a consanguinious marriage, 3d cousins 1 remove~~,
but it appears not to be so.

This appears to have been a Savage-esque leap to a tempting conclusion; dates are wrong by 5 or 6 years from the Samuel and Lydia Boynton siblings buried in Cornish, and there is indeed another set of Samuel and Lydia Boynton siblings. 

Per [F-A-G 182374016](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/182374016/noah-jewett) and
Maine Nathan Hale Cemetery records (_details below_), J#587 Deac. Noah d.     10 Oct 1839 (aged 82)  
Cornish, York Co, ME; Buried in Ricker Ancient Burial Ground aka Old High Rd Cem. there.

[Saco Valley Settlers](https://archive.org/details/sacovalleysettle00byuridl/page/139/mode/1up) 
at "Founders of Cornish" pp 139-140 
says Deacon Jewett's brother-in-law Samuel Boynton is from Stratham New Hampshire.

> ***Dea. Noah Jewett*** was one of the founders of Cornish, and was chosen 
a deacon of the first church organization; a carpenter by trade and in the year 
1800 built the first Cornish meeting-house from a plan made by Dr. Cyrus 
Snell, now in existence. Deacon Jewett was a genuine Puritan, possessing the 
stern religious zeal chatacteristic of his time. He was fully conscious of 
the importance of his sacred office, and claimed a share of that deference 
supposed to be due to the dignitaries of the period. He had not only failings 
but the virtues of the Puritan believer; in person said to be small, of swarthy 
complexion, and led forward by an enormous nose, a facial appendage that has 
been duplicated by some of his descendants who are supposed to be proud of 
this inheritance from the anatomy of their progenitor. 

> (For the family genealogy, see second part. ) 

_but alas no Jewett genealogy is included there._

> ...(continues)...

> **Samuel Boynton**, one of the early settlers, 
came from Stratham, N.H.,  and was brother-in-law of ***Deacon Jewett***.  
He settled on the High road; was  a worthy man, possessed of a “peppery
temper”; capable in town business;  in person tall and spare. 
He was twice married; second wife, Mary Deering,  a short, stout, 
intellectual woman of serene temperament, well calculated to  get on with the crusty husband.
She was an unwavering believer in ghosts,  witches,
and fairies, and in her old age caused troubled dreams for the 
children by the stories she told of what she had seen and heard.

_Alas Genealogy section does not in fact give his parents._



* WikiTree has parentage of Noah's wife Lydia, with estimated birth consistent with [F-a-G reading of gravestone, 1757](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/182374014/lydia-jewett) instead of ~~J#325 Lydia's b. 1751~~,
and _also_ having a brother Samuel, who fits Samuuel buried across town, and the Saca Valley "brother in law".

* Maine's [Nathan Hale Cemetery Records Collection](https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QVJ5-4Y3P) provides a second transcription of gravestones (taken 1975), confirming b. 1757 d. 1827; which argues strongly against ~~J#817 Lydia~~ being Mrs Noah (_and makes the excess foliage in FaG photo not a problem_) -


> Image [1405](https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:3QS7-89FW-F9NP?i=1404&cc=2241461) of 1542 (hers [1360](https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:3QSQ-G9FW-FSWQ?i=1359&cc=2241461&personaUrl=%2Fark%3A%2F61903%2F1%3A1%3AQVJ5-4YSH) of 1542)

Noah Jewett            82 Burial 1839 	Cornish   Old High Rd      11 Feb 1758 	 1758  10 Oct 1839  007586605

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So I consider this ~~possible consanguinous~~ Lydia disproved,
and need to dig deeper to see if the WikiTree line from Mrs Lydia (Boynton) Jewett back to
_Early Rowley Settler_ (Rev Ed 1933)
[John¹ Boynton](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x000380798&view=1up&seq=61&q1=John%20Boynton) ESR#22,
[Samuel²](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x000380798&view=1up&seq=62&q1=John%20Boynton) ESR#22-7, 
Daniel³ #22-30 is confirmable. 

Of _Jewett_ interest, **John¹ Boynton** was first husband of &#x2461;  ***Maximilian Jewett^3***'s 2d wife Eleanor.

Alas [The Boynton Family](https://archive.org/details/boyntonfamilygen00boyn/page/71/mode/2up) 1897 
gives a not-quite-certain _by even Victorian standards_ parentage for Samuel Jr, and no sister Lydia;
and _Saco Valley_ promised a Jewett genealogy in part 2 but didn't deliver.

(parents of J#587 ***Dea. Noah***), can be found in
