# Jewett Ancestors not previously listed

This page reports my tangled Jewett pedigree, noting additional Descendants (non-living only) of [_Jewetts of America_](https://archive.org/search?query=%22Jewetts+of+America%22) ([OpenLibrary](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL7001732M/History_and_genealogy_of_the_Jewetts_of_America#editions-list)) volumes 1 & 2 persons therein. (_Hereafter referred to as JoA and the numbering there as J#._)

As far as I know (AFAIK), none of the un-numbered persons listed here were in the Newsletters, Quarterly, or Annual publications of the society. (_If [JoA society](https://www.jewett.org/) newsletter editor would like this reformatted for newsletter, i would consider - and will also share further details with the Historian._)

Siblings and/or parents of two numbered ancestors mentioned here do appear in Newsletter/Quarterly articles, but not discussing the un-numbered ancestors given here, as noted below.


I've made my own [index of Vols 3 & 4 clusters](joa-v3+4-clusters.html), and i have verified none of those newly numbered clusters match these un-numbered lines. Though several are adjacent: 

* J#17 Hannnah [JoA:iii:1], aunt & m. cousin, sibling of ancestor J#15 Jeremiah , which latter is in my [J#217](#j217-hannah-jewett) Hannah and [J#7151](#j7151-david-nathaniel-jewett) David N lines; 
* J#22 Joseph  [JoA:iii:14], Step-father, and half-sibling of ancestor J#15 Jeremiah, so ½uncle, ditto;
* J#63 Jonathan  [JoA:iii:26], uncle, bro. of J#64 Aquila [iii:26], which latter is in my [J#4624](#j4624-jewett-florence-anna) Florence and [J#1341](#j1341-jewett-sarah-aka-sally) Sarah  lines; 
* J#645 James [JoA:iii:154], Uncle, bro. of ancestor J#646 Moses, which latter is in my [J#7151](#j7151-david-nathaniel-jewett) David N line; James died of woulds at seige of Louisburg, where many ancestors fought, some died ; 
* J#2735 Moses [iv:878], uncle, as bro. of ancestor J#2736 Joseph, which latter is in my [J#7151](#j7151-david-nathaniel-jewett) David N line.

## Chart Key

* This view shows connection of  &#x2460; **J#1 Edward** to your humble reporter, who would appear two lines below the bottom margin. 
* This view is omitting non-Jewett in-laws as well as all living persons. Produced in the [GRAMPS desktop program](https://gramps-project.org/blog/).
* On Marriage: Red &#x1F7E5; denotes consanguineous marriage; often but not always Jewett! Text below should indicate degree of cousinship.
* On Person: red &#x1f534; is medical doctor; <span style="background-color:cyan">sky blue</span> is immigrant; orange &#x1F7E0; is unsure connection; purples &#x1f7ea; are clergy or deacon/elder; <span style="background-color:  #9bdd47">lt.green</span> is proprietor; dk.brown &#x1F7EB; is slave-holder; medium blue &#x1F7E6; is soldier or militia, if paired with <span style="background-color: #75507B; color: #FFFFFF">deep purple</span>, Revolutionary service; <span style="background-color:tan">tan</span> is Mayflower descent line carrier (marked &#x1F4AE; in text below).  Black &#x25A0; marks end of line on old wall fan-chart, (or killed/executed/witch, but not on _this_ chart).  (_These colors are my own mnemonic choices for my selection of filterable "tags" on people and families in GRAMPS._)
* <span style="background-color:grey">grey strikeout</span> One line from my parents' fan-chart, J#6 Ezekiel to J#817 Lydia, I think is busted; the line is correct in the JoA books, but it's not the _right_ Lydia for _our_ tree; and so appears struck-out with translucent gray above, and is discussed below [re J#587 Deac. Noah Jewett’s wife Lydia](#re-j587-deac.-noah-jewetts-wife-lydia-is-not-j325-lydia
).

## Notations

Numbers that are prefixed with **J#** (pr prefixed with only **#** in chart above) are [_Jewetts of America_](https://archive.org/search?query=%22Jewetts+of+America%22) numbers from those books, which books are referred to as **JoA**. 

Other family descendency ids provided as _Cross-Reference_ are identified when used and listed in [Bibliography](#bibliography-for-cross-reference-numbers). 

Jewett Descent Generation numbers are shown in circles &#x2468;&nbsp; in the descent outline. These are usually given as superscripts^9^ in most other family genealogies, but the JoA books use the descent number as superscript, ala Aquila^64^,  Maximilian^3^; which I will use here only when quoting the JoA known descent.  Generations from **other** families' progenitor are shown conventionally as Noah^5^ Barker.

##  &#x2465; &#x2466; Confusion of multiple Lydia Boynton

Deac. Noah Jewett's wife Lydia (Boynton) is not J#325 Lydia Jewett (Boynton)'s daughter J#817 Lydia Boynton but another Lydia Boynton.

In which we find less connection between

* &#x2465;  J#587 Deac. Noah Jewett  
(Stephen^198^, Aquila^64^, Joseph^11^, Maximilian^3^, Edward^1^),  
[[JoA:i:88,165-167]](https://archive.org/details/historygenealogy01jewe/page/165/mode/1up?q=587+Noah+Lydia)
* &#x2466;  J#817 Lydia Boynton 
(Lydia^325^, Samuel^117^, Francis^24^, Ezeliel^6^, Maximilian^3^, Edward^1^)
[[JoA:i:61,111]](https://archive.org/details/historygenealogy01jewe/page/111/mode/1up?q=325+Lydia+Boynton+817)

than _we_ had suspected. (JoA books did _not_ claim she was a Jewett.)
Deac Noah's wife Lydia (Boynton) Jewett _was_ a cousin of his cousin of same name, but *not* the same person.

This section discusses a tempting confusion of two cousins named Lydia Boynton, one of which has a Jewett mother and the other a Jewett husband. Had their identity been confirmed, it would have provided a marriage for &#x2466; J#817 Lydia and in-laws for &#x2465; J#587 Noah, both of  which were lacking. 
With all the &#x1F7E5; consanguineous Jewett marriages, it was reasonable *but wrong* to attempt to identify them.  
Instead we only can offer an as yet unverified claim of in-laws for Deacon Noah and citations for his mother and her first husband. So this is more a <span class=RoY>&#x26A0;</span> Warning and case study in rejecting spurious connections, but has those bits of potential news as well. 

J#587 ***Deacon Noah Jewett***'s wife Lydia Boynton (Jewett) ***could almost plausibly*** have been &#x2466; <span style="background-color:grey">~~J#817 Lydia Boynton~~</span>, 
daughter of &#x2465; J#325 Lydia Jewett (Boynton) (m. John Boynton), daughter of &#x2464; J#117  Samuel Jewett (sr) (who died in Hollis N.H.) 
and thus would have been sister of &#x2466; J#816 Samuel Boynton;
and if so ~~this would have been a &#x1F7E5; consanguineous Jewett marriage, 3d cousins 1 remove~~,
but it appears not to be so.

* _Cross-References_ &mdash;
    - <span style="background-color:grey">~~J#325 Lydia Jewett~~</span> with children Lydia and Samuel is at [[JoA:1:111]](https://archive.org/details/historygenealogy01jewe/page/111/mode/1up?q=816+Samuel+817+Lydia+325); alas J#816 Samuel and J#817 Lydia are not further expanded in JoA vols 1 &mldr; 4. 
    - J#325 Lydia appears on the wild web as [<span class=RoY>&#x26A0;</span> WT Boynton-474](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Boynton-474), but that offers little news; did she thrive, marry? TBD.
    - J#587 Deac Noah Jewett is at [[JoA:1:88,165]](https://archive.org/details/historygenealogy01jewe/page/165/mode/1up?q=587) 

This appears to have been a Savage-esque leap to a tempting conclusion. 
An old local history volume says wife Lydia had a brother Samuel, and came from New Hampshire, which fits both ladies. 
An astonishing coincidence? 
Not when we observe the onomastics: both Lydia and Samuel are Boynton familial names, so siblings with same names as their cousins is not unlikely. 

I haven't seen this connection in print outside our family, so I'm not sure if my parents read this somewhere that I haven't found, or made the false, hopeful connection on their own. Quite possibly it was the work of my Grandfather's college roommate (late 1920s), who did the only work on our family before Dad started in 1950s.  "Em Greenway" was a 1st generation American, so his class-assignment recommended methods & resources for doing a New England Genealogy wouldn't apply, especially not in a timely fashion, to _his_ family, so he got both instructor and roommate permissions to do his *roommate*'s solidly Yankee family. (Ricker/Jewett/Swett etc.)

The B/D dates are wrong by 5 or 6 years from the Samuel and Lydia Boynton siblings buried in Cornish, and there is indeed another set of Samuel and Lydia Boynton siblings (presumably Boynton cousins of the other set; a Rowley allied-family that went to So. Maine via mid NH.). 

Per [F-A-G 182374016](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/182374016/noah-jewett) and
Maine Nathan Hale Cemetery records (_details below_), J#587 Deac. Noah 
d.     10 Oct 1839 (aged 82) 
Cornish, York Co, ME, and wife Lydia are buried in Ricker Ancient Burial Ground aka Old High Rd Cem. there.
(_These eponymous Rickers would be distant cousins of ours._)

[Saco Valley Settlers](https://archive.org/details/sacovalleysettle00byuridl/page/139/mode/1up) 
at "Founders of Cornish" pp 139-140 
says Deacon Jewett's brother-in-law Samuel Boynton is from Stratham New Hampshire.

> ***Dea. Noah Jewett*** was one of the founders of Cornish, and was chosen 
a deacon of the first church organization; a carpenter by trade and in the year 
1800 built the first Cornish meeting-house from a plan made by Dr. Cyrus 
Snell, now in existence. Deacon Jewett was a genuine Puritan, possessing the 
stern religious zeal chatacteristic of his time. He was fully conscious of 
the importance of his sacred office, and claimed a share of that deference 
supposed to be due to the dignitaries of the period. He had not only failings 
but the virtues of the Puritan believer; in person said to be small, of swarthy 
complexion, and led forward by an enormous nose, a facial appendage that has 
been duplicated by some of his descendants who are supposed to be proud of 
this inheritance from the anatomy of their progenitor. 
> (For the family genealogy, see second part. ) 

_but alas the promised Jewett genealogy was not actually provided there?_

> ...[_continues_]...  
> **Samuel Boynton**, one of the early settlers, 
came from Stratham, N.H.,  and was brother-in-law of ***Deacon Jewett***.  
He settled on the High road; was  a worthy man, possessed of a “peppery
temper”; capable in town business;  in person tall and spare. 
He was twice married; second wife, Mary Deering,  a short, stout, 
intellectual woman of serene temperament, well calculated to  get on with the crusty husband.
She was an unwavering believer in ghosts,  witches,
and fairies, and in her old age caused troubled dreams for the 
children by the stories she told of what she had seen and heard.

_Alas Genealogy section does not in fact give his parents._



* <span class=RoY>&#x26A0;</span> WikiTree's Lydia [Boynton-360](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Boynton-360) Jewett, wife of Deac. Noah, has parentage with estimated birth consistent with [F-a-G reading of gravestone b. 1757](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/182374014/lydia-jewett) instead of ~~J#817 Lydia's b. 1751~~,
and _also_ having brother Samuel, who matches well enough to a Samuel Boynton buried across town and the Saco Valley "brother in law".

* Maine's [Nathan Hale Cemetery Records Collection](https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QVJ5-4Y3P) provides a second transcription of gravestones (taken 1975), confirming reading of Lydia b. 1757 d. 1827; which argues strongly against ~~J#817 Lydia~~ being Mrs Noah (_and sidesteps issue of excess foliage in FaG photo blocking independent interpretation_). -

So I consider this ~~possible consanguineous~~ Lydia disproved,
and need to dig deeper to see if the <span class=RoY>&#x26A0;</span> WikiTree line from Mrs Lydia (Boynton) Jewett back to
_Early Rowley Settler_ (Rev Ed 1933)'s
[John¹ Boynton ESR#22](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x000380798&view=1up&seq=61&q1=John%20Boynton) ,
[Samuel² ESR#22-7](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x000380798&view=1up&seq=62&q1=John%20Boynton) , 
Daniel³ ESR#22-30 (_loc.cit._), thence Samuel^4^, Lydia^5^ (& Samuel^5^) might be confirmable with documents, TBD. 

Of _Jewett_ interest, **John¹ Boynton** was the first husband of &#x2461;  ***J#3 Maximilian Jewett***'s 2d wife, the thrice-widowed ***Eleanor (Pell) (Boynton) (Jewett) Warner***; she's great-many-grand-step-mother to most of us, and thus any Boynton is _at least_ a step-cousin.

Alas [The Boynton Family](https://archive.org/details/boyntonfamilygen00boyn/page/71/mode/2up), 1897, p.71,
gives a not-quite-certain _even by Victorian standards_ parentage for Samuel, and no sister Lydia;
and _Saco Valley_ promised a Jewett genealogy in part 2 but didn't deliver.

### Hannah, wife of &#x2464; J#198 Dea. Stephen Jewett (sr) 

Further information on birth and (m.1) families of widow ***Hannah^4^ (Farwell) Cummings (Jewett)***, wife of **J#198** ***Dea. Stephen Jewett*** (sr) ([[JoA:1:48,86]](https://archive.org/details/historygenealogy01jewe/page/86/mode/1up?q=198))
and mother of **J#587** ***Dea. Noah***, can be found in

* [Cummings Memorial](https://archive.org/details/cummingsmemorial00inmooa/page/51/mode/1up?q=38+Jerahmeel), 1903, pp. 22, 52; which spells Hannah's m.1's name **Ensign _Jerahmeel_ Cummings**; which also tells us that our Deac. Stephen was *not* widow Hannah's first suitor, but the first who *respected* her; which may explain her 5 years of independence between.
* On her mother's side, Hannah is of the Richardsons of Woburn.

The _Book_ of Dow uses a modified [Henry System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genealogical_numbering_systems#Henry_System) of enumeration using letters to code birth order rather than digits (which evades having to mix digits and letters for 10th and later). This is quite convenient for computing cousinship, but out of fashion in modern genealogy which largely uses [The Register](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genealogical_numbering_systems#Register_System) system for descent, in preference to the [NGSQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genealogical_numbering_systems#NGSQ_System) that so many Victorian/Edwardian family histories used, and of course [Ahnentafel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genealogical_numbering_systems#Ahnentafel) for ascent into ancestors.

    - Note:_ <span class=RoY>&#x26A0;</span> _Family and person numbers in RevEd(1933) are **different** from original 1887 Essex Inst edition._ <span class=RoY>&#x26A0;</span> _E.g., our J#3 Deac. Max Jewett is ESR#100 in RevEd, ESR87#54 in 1887 E.I. 1st Ed.; so nearly twice as many families!_
    - Both editions of ESR use a modification of NGSQ numbering in which the progenitors are numbered alphabetically by surname, with migrant brothers both in Rowley getting their own entries, ordered by age precedence, if father not also in Rowley. That number becomes the family prefix with a dash for their descent, who are numbered within the family as if NGSQ, so our Max is `100` (ESR#100 in my notation), and his first born is `100-1. Ezekiel²` there, ESR#100-1 here, while JoA sees him as `6 Ezekiel` or Ezekiel^6^.
