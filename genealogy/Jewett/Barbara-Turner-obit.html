<p>It is with deep sadness that Cary Presbyterian says goodbye to
Dr. Barbara Turner, whose presence and impact at CPC were constant.
Barbara was almost always here, preparing for her beloved children’s
Sunday School class, or changing a church display case, or coming in to
update the roll books, or to attend a Bible study. She was always doing
something at church.</p>
<p>Barbara, a school psychologist, was an Elder, who led a
non-denominational group of adults over 55 at the church. She was active
in Presbyterian Women, participating in more than one circle. Barbara
also served as a Stephen Minister, sang in the choir, was Cary’s liaison
with our Madagascar missionaries, and was devoted to the after-school
program for at-risk children, Loaves &amp; Fishes in Raleigh. As church
historian, Barbara was always taking pictures - dutifully recording
pageants, baptisms, ordinations, and new member receptions - dating back
to 1970, when she began helping the church secretary… and then became
church secretary.</p>
<p>Barbara’s husband Jim died July 9, 2020. She leaves behind their son
Tim, his wife Kim and many friends here at Cary Presbyterian.</p>
<p>More than the many things Barbara was busy doing, she was a person
who had a deep relational impact upon her fellow Presbyterians. That
legacy lives on in the strengthened faith, the waxing impulse to
kindness, and the tireless work of those who have followed her in
selfless servanthood. We will miss Barbara but are glad that she now
joins the saints in the light.</p>

Outstanding Older Adult Award by New Hope Presbytery in 2018.</p>

<p>If you want to send condolences to Tim and Kim, please contact the
church office at this link for their mailing address.</p>
<p>If you wish to make memorial gifts in memory of Barbara, you may send
or bring them to the church office. We will hold them awaiting guidance
from Tim about how they might be used.</p>
