<hr />
<p>(We got a flurry of new list members at Arisia [2017], and it’s been
a while since I talked about this on list, so some background is
probably in order.)</p>
<p>MaltCon is a “virtual con within a con”, taking place within the
context of a literary SF convention.  (It is possible for a MaltCon to
take place outside that context, but it has not thus far.)</p>
<p>It began in 2005.  MaltCon member <strong>Laura Anne Gilman</strong>
was Executive Editor at the Roc Books SF/fantasy imprint of
Penguin/Putnam, and maintained a newsgroup on SFF.Net.  Various of the
Usual Suspects were hanging out in her group, and saying</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Philcon is fast approaching. Has anyone heard from Programming about
what they want us to do?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Philcon was being its usual “Wait till <em>after</em> the last
minute” self, and no one had.  (It’s better about that now.)  The
discussion reduced to</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We’ll all be together at a con, in a hotel with a good bar and
single malt selection.  We’ll find each other, have single malt, and
have fun.  Who <em>cares</em> what Programming does?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Philcon 2005 was [the <a
href="https://fancyclopedia.org/Philcon">last</a> held] at Center City
Marriott. The badge art was a picture Tom Powers had taken of LAG’s hand
holding a wee dram. Laura Anne is our patroness in consequence. <a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>A light bulb blinked on over my head - MaltCon, a virtual con within
a con.  I created MaltCon badges (whose graphic was a picture of Laura
Anne’s hand holding a tasting glass of scotch), and gave them out at
Philcon. </p>
<p>It started an informal tradition. For a few years, MaltCon was
<em>very</em> low key.  You encountered me at a con.  I had a flask. 
Perhaps you did too.  We shared single malt and I gave you a badge.</p>
<p>People began to say “I have a room where we can get together and
share interesting drams”, and it started to become a group. </p>
<p>[<em>So</em>] I created this mailing list as a Google Group in March
of 2008 as a way we could keep in touch, plan for future gatherings, and
share news and notes on spirits.</p>
<p>[<em>Dennis’s 2008 MaltCon Google Group (aka list) invitation
message:</em>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since it seems to be taking on a life of its own, I thought I’d take
MaltCon to the next level. I’ve created a mailing list for the Usual
Suspects to hang out, plan for future instances of MaltCon, and discuss
our favorite beverage. I anticipate the list will be low traffic.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This is not a public list. Membership is by invitation, and the group
is not visible in Google’s public lists or searches. If you know other
folks you think should be here, drop me their names and email addresses
offline.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>… it’s the day after Lunacon, with too little sleep and lots of
single malt … I look forward to your presence. <a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>[<em>Official Group description:</em>] <a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A discussion area for members of MaltCon, the “virtual con within a
con” devoted to the joys of single malt whiskey.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Bill:] <em>Backspacing to January 2004, my family met <strong>Elaine
Brennan</strong> while having brunch at a Park Plaza Arisia, 2004,
discussing upcoming local WorldCon, Noreascon 4. We quickly discovered
Scotch was among our shared interests. Elaine was aware of several sets
of Fans (and Pros) who had small Scotch sharing circles out of
sight.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There have always been bottles of single malts at Smofcon, and those
bottles have always been shared – even well before Maltcon became a
thing. [-Elaine] <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Bill:] <em>Elaine introduced me to TechnoFandom’s custom of carrying
a road case of leftover party supplies (though I knew some of TF
previously through NESFA + Boskone). (And thereby we also got to use the
Presidential Suite’s lavatory used by President Clinton.) We hatched a
plot to attempt to cross-fertilize those multiple circles.</em> <a
href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>[Bill:] <em>I did some TF work at Noreascon 4 and took a
special-order bottle of Caol Ila Cognac Finish to the N4 TF party.
(G&amp;M PC, special order with Joe @ Federal, I told him I’d take two
bottles if i could get it by N4; took MBTA to pick it up Saturday of
con. Amazingly most at TF party complained it was too smokey. Elaine was
by then laid-up with a stress-fracture of the foot; we spent a few hours
with Elaine and Pam entertaining each other with tales and me pouring
Caol Ila for Elaine and applying first cold then warm compresses to the
foot — not a cure, but it sure helped :-) Once Dennis coined the phrase
MaltCon and invited badges-as-invites, we became a committee of three on
this mission.</em> [BR] <a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> , <a href="#fn8"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>[Back to Dennis:]</p>
<p>Whenever there are enough folks with hip flasks, and
<strong>Bill</strong>, <strong>Elaine</strong>, or I get a chance to
make badges, Presto! Instant MaltCon. Just add single malt. <a
href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>[<em>Going forward, Bill, <strong>Paul, and RKOV</strong> are the
carriers of MaltCon label. And we hope someday Elaine again?</em>
[BR]]</p>
<p>I met Bill Ricker at Arisia in 2001.<br />
[<em>OTOH, it might have been 2004? Dennis was on InnKeeper desk.</em>
[BR]]<br />
[<em>Dennis remembered meeting Elaine at MilPhil 2001.</em> [offlist
email Dennis to BR]]</p>
<p>Bill was a major scotch fan, and had a road case of interesting
things he’d accumulated, so Bill’s stock formed the base for early group
efforts.</p>
<p>[Bill: <em>I describe that as the stones for making <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Soup"><strong>stone
soup</strong></a>. At the time, Seth and I were both on good bonus plans
and were actively collecting. Seth came by airplane so he brought a lot
of very small samples. I travelled by car so brought the larger ones,
and thus variety was assured. <br /><strong>Stones for Stone
soup</strong>. <br />¶ My road case was acquired cheap at the <a
href="https://w1mx.mit.edu/flea-at-mit/">MIT Swapfest</a> to ship Scotch
(<strong>Black Adder “Smoking Islay”</strong>, 55% bot.2006) and the
world’s ugliest ashtray (same sourcing as road case) to the west-coast
when celebrating winter holidays with my mentor in Scotch,
Technico-Aesthetic Criticism, and SciFi as Lit Crit, <strong><a
href="../MAP/">Mike “MAP” Padlipsky</a></strong>. <br />This dram was
subject of the first reply <a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> on MaltCon list,
approriately enough by patroness Laura Anne Gilman aka LAG! <br />On
which trip MAP blind-tasted me on <strong>McCarthy’s Oregon Peated
Whiskey</strong>, Clear Creek Dis., challenging me to guess the age and
location; I did not guess Oregon 3y/o. When I told this to <strong>Joe @
Federal</strong>, he reached back without looking and picked it off the
shelf for me. (Which is excactly what his boss Len had done a decade
earlier when i asked for a better but affordable cognac.) So those were
the two drams in my two “try this” blind tasting flasks at Arisia a few
weeks later. <br />One of the bottles I opened at <a
href="../MAP/Malt/tasting.html">MAP’s Wake</a> will be at Dennis’s
MaltCon remembrance(s).</em>]</p>
<p>“The donations will make their next appearance at the [<em>next
MaltCon</em>] Expression … and become part of group stocks.” <a
href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>It’s taken on a life of its own.  There [have been] formal MaltCon
Expressions at Arisia, Boskone, [Lunacon,] Heliosphere, [ReaderCon,]
Albacon, Philcon, [<em>and one or two official at each of WorldCon &amp;
World Fantasy Con</em> [<em>merged from</em> <a href="#fn12"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>]].</p>
<p>[B]ut there are unofficial gatherings at other places that are
planned on this list, like gatherings at Worldcons.  There are also
gathering similar to ours elsewhere.  For instance, Covert Beach holds
scotch parties at Balticon and Capclave[;] MaltCon has an overlapping
membership with his efforts, and his gatherings get announced here.  If
Bill or I should make one of Covert’s events, we’re civilians.  It’s his
show and he does it well. [<em>Now called <strong>“Quiet
Gathering”</strong>, with <strong>Bob MacIntosh</strong> and
<strong>Mike Nelson</strong>, well known among MaltCon, as
coordinators.</em> [BR]]</p>
<p>MaltCon began with an emphasis on single malts, but I’ve been pushing
to expand the group’s taste. We’ve always had bourbon, which is at least
a first cousin, but my assumption is that every spirit has offerings
considered top shelf.  Educate me!  Share some with us. Tell us how
quality is defined in your preferred spirit, and what makes you like to
drink it.  That expansion has been proceeding nicely, and gin, tequila,
rye and other things can now be found in our spread.</p>
<p>The emphasis is on sharing, and at this point, everything you see
laid out at an Expression was contributed by MaltCon members. [<em>We
strongly suggest sharing at next visit; first visit it’s not
expected.</em>] Some bottles go back home with their owners, and others
were donated to the group stocks for which Bill is the Curator. [The
Stone Soup is doing well. Thank you all!]</p>
<p>MaltCon is a virtual con within a con. It is a separate function that
just happens to take place at an SF convention, and [usually] has no
formal or official connection with the surrounding con. It is a private
party hosted in the room of a guest at the hotel and the guest may have
whom they please in their room. … Attendance at a MaltCon expression
requires an invite or a MaltCon badge (and invitees without a badge are
normally given one at the expression.) There is <em>no</em> requirement
for a membership in the surrounding convention, and people invited may
have no interest in the surrounding con. They are there because of
whisky, not SF. If there is a requirement that an attendee at the party
be a member of the surrounding convention in addition to having a
MaltCon badge or being a MaltCon invitee, that party is <em>not</em> a
MaltCon expression, and the actual MaltCon expression will take place in
a space that does not impose that requirement. <a href="#fn13"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>In keeping with its virtual nature, MaltCon has only as much
organization as is necessary to function.  We have not yet had actual
programming, though that’s not out of the question.  Bill <em>has</em>
done a “tour of Scotland in four drams”, as an introduction to single
malts for new attendees unfamiliar with them, but whether that occurs
depends on the expression, and whether there is time and space for
it.</p>
<p>One tradition that <em>has</em> arisen is that I sometimes lead
formal <strong>“Absent Friends”</strong> and <strong><em>“Fuck
Cancer!”</em></strong> toasts to those no longer with us [<em>and as
wishes for friends fighting Cancer</em>[BR]].  A depressing number are
folks I knew personally, and several were MaltCon attendees and on this
list.</p>
<p>[<em>And now we add <strong>Dennis</strong> himself to that list; as
many as I can reconstruct are listed below.</em> [BR]]</p>
<p>My response when asked why I do this is simple. <br /> “I want to
have a party at the con I want to attend, with fine spirits I want to
drink, and attended by people I want to hang out with at a con.” <br />
Knowledge of spirits if not required - we can impart it.  Congeniality
is.  We’ve had very few altercations between people who just didn’t get
along, and I want it to stay that way. <a href="#fn14"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>MaltCon Expressions have somewhat different characters, influenced by
size and location.  Arisia [was] by far the largest Expression, and size
brings other things in its wake.  A few years back we shifted to Stealth
mode, where we deliberately try to be as low key as possible. Arisia is
a party con skewing to a younger demographic, and we had too many
problems with folks whose spider sense detected a party and were looking
to get hammered.  That’s not what we’re about.  We’re about tasting and
learning. We try to avoid people even knowing we exist unless we tell
them. <br />[<em>and since then it’s gotten even more careful if at all
there</em>[BR]]</p>
<p>The Boskone Expression is similar to Arisia’s, with an overlapping
attendance, but is smaller because Boskone is.</p>
<p>Albacon is a small relaxacon, with a tiny fraction of Arisia’s
attendance.  The Albacon Expression will be a main con party, and
[2019]’s GoH Chuck Gannon is a MaltCon member. <br />[<em>MaltCon was
invited to Albacon.</em>[BR]]</p>
<p>At Philcon, MaltCon is the <em>de facto</em> pro party since SFWA no
longer hosts a party there, and [has been] unofficially assisted by the
con.</p>
<p>HELIOsphere [was] a new con, and [which desired a] new MaltCon
Expression.</p>
<p>[<em>ReaderCon and Lunacon had had MaltCon in years gone by,</em>
(<em>see time-line in appendices</em>) <em>and we’ll be returning to
ReaderCon by invitation this summer 2025.</em> [BR]]</p>
<p>I think I also speak for Bill here when I say I’m <em>delighted</em>
at the way MaltCon has progressed. [<em>Agreed!</em> [BR]]</p>
<p>Thank you all for being part of it.</p>

<p>DMcCunney dennis.mccunney@gmail.com has invited you to join the
MaltCon group with this message:</p>
<p>Hi, folks,</p>
<p>Since it seems to be taking on a life of its own, I thought I’d take
MaltCon to the next level. I’ve created a mailing list for the Usual
Suspects to hang out, plan for future instances of MaltCon, and discuss
our favorite beverage. I anticipate the list will be low traffic.</p>
<p>This is not a public list. Membership is by invitation, and the group
is not visible in Google’s public lists or searches. If you know other
folks you think should be here, drop me their names and email addresses
offline.</p>
<p>A couple of you have spouses whose email addresses I don’t have
handy. Please invite them. And feel free to smack me on the head and say
“Hey, stupid! You forgot X!”, because it’s the day after Lunacon, with
too little sleep and lots of single malt, and I undoubtedly have.</p>
<p>I look forward to your presence.</p>

<p>Caol Ila Cognac finish that I had at Noreascon [IV]: was in this
series; sadly not in current offerings, the Tokaji or Sassicaia barrel
offerings don’t do it for me. (although the Caol Ila Madeira wood was
fine a few years ago.) (This line also includes some seriously old
vintages, 1940’s-1970’s, but those and “Generations” 70yo won’t be in a
public tasting.) I also have Imperial Port Wood PC. You might think i
like G&amp;M from the above … you’d be right.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This omits the rest of the legend. I ordered it at a tasting shortly
before N4, telling Joe @ Federal if he could get it for me for Noreascon
I’d take two, one for con one for later. It came in after I’d already
moved into hotel, so I had to take T and a backpack to fetch it. I spent
an evening applying cold then warm compresses to Elaine’s damaged foot
and Caol Ila to rest of Elaine. It didn’t cure Elaine’s foot, but it
sure helped :-). The walkway from Pru to Marriot C-P had locked down by
the time my kidlet was swooning in wee-hours (so much for staying awake
24 hours!), so I tipped a cab handsomely to drive us one block from
Sheraton.</p>

heart is actually fine; it was caused by the systemic stress of another
serious medical condition, which it brought to appropriate attention,
and for which he’s now had the initial surgery. But he faces a long
rehab road to recovery now.</p>

<p>P.S. Am I accurately remembering a mention last year of Joe having a
cameo in a Paul Giamatti film?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, which is now available for streaming.<br />
<strong>“The Holdovers”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Shot on location at Federal, among many other Boston and area
locations.<br />
The 1970s decor wasn’t entirely removed, here’s my pic of 1970s
brown-rainbow on the coolers.<br />
I think it goes nicely with the decorative tiles over the door.</p>

<p>I note in passing “<strong>The Holdovers</strong>” was nominated in
multiple BAFTAs categories, and won for Susan Shopmaker, casting dir.,
for “Casting” and for Da’Vine Joy Randolph, “Best Supporting
Actress”.<br />
Given the previously noted media buzz/discussion of Joe’s scene and one
line, I’ll consider the “Casting” win a partial win for Joe ;-) . Losing
to <em>Oppenheimer</em> in other categories is no shame this year -
BAFTA was all about serious films this year; even <em>Barbie</em>, a
comedy with a heart of serious commentary, got blanked. For a 1970s
period-piece comedy-of-manners to get anything was sailing against
headwinds of history.</p>

<p>My prior (2023) comments on list re this photo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And in his natural environment - they’d rented the store for the
evening shoot.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>They did a very nice job of “stage setting” to make it reasonably
authentically 1970s package store, so I heard. (1970s is before Lennie
bought the store - he bought mid 80’s and upgraded the stock and
clientele, and later hired Joe who took Scotch to the next level.) IDK
if they borrowed actual antique bottles from collectors or created
replicas; probably heard at the time.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I saw the 1970s swoosh graphics still on the beer coolers a few days
later, still in place. I thought i had a photo of the 1970s decor but i
can’t find it. Aha! I looked up when they shot here, Feb &amp; Mar of
2022. [<a

Globe</a>] Apparently i visited Joe after visiting the Dentist on the
24th, one of the few times i’ve ridden the (T) since Plague. (Boston
must have had good sewer viral load that week.)</p>

re Road Case</a></p>
<p>The original TF road case, for an HP LaserJet4, was acquired off the
conv. center loading dock at the 1998 Worldcon “Bucconeer”. Apparently
it had been kicking around the dock for a couple of months and one of
the local guys pretty much said “It’s in the way”; we helped tidy up the
place.<a href="#fnref18" class="footnote-back"

re MidAmeriCon ii</a></p>
<p>At MidAmeriCon 2 (2016) there was a meeting of the “Refined Barley
Products Council” or something like that. Wasn’t a MC because neither
Dennis nor Bill could be there; hosted in the Tech suite. IIRC
attendance was decent and pretty much BYO (I brought four whiskys as a
starter). There is the possibility of a similar meeting at the Seattle
worldcon.<a href="#fnref20" class="footnote-back"

Post</a></p>
<p>Welcome to the MaltCon mailing list. The list is an adjunct to the
virtual con within a con devoted to the joys of single malt whiskey,
where members can keep in touch and discuss our favorite beverage when a
MaltCon isn’t actually taking place somewhere.</p>
<p>This is a moderated invitation only list. The atmosphere is relaxed
and rules are few. This is a place for hanging out and casual
conversation. The main topic is single malt whiskey, but I know better
than to expect that is all that might be discussed. As long as things
wander back on topic occasionally, I’m happy.</p>
<p>It’s possible that disagreements will occur. That happens too,
especially in subjective matters of taste. If it starts to get heated
and personal, take it to private email, so the rest of us don’t have to
listen.</p>
<p>Beyond that, come on in, kick off your shoes, pour a shot of your
favorite brand, and relax in good company.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
