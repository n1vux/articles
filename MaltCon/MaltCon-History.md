#     History of MaltCon

_In order to honor Dennis's work, I'm editing and publishing his
unpublished, coordinated draft of MaltCon history. 
I'm hopeful that I might keep this as an ongoing project?
If so, the current convenient location is possibly temporary._[BR] 

## 2017 draft history by Dennis McCunney

_The following history is built on a skeleton of a Draft that Dennis McCunney wrote in early 2017_
[^2017-01-19_Draft] 
_that was reviewed by Bill R, and Dennis revised once;_
_and was intended for posting to the mailing list later that month, but never posted._
_So I'm using it to let Dennis give his own Eulogy._

_I've augmented by pieces pulled from list archives *etc*., as noted with footnotes;_
_those are also by Dennis, unless otherwise marked in the footnote._

_Corrigenda should be sent directly to me, Bill._

_— Bill, hereafter_ [BR]

[_Longer  editorial insertions prefixed _[Bill:]_, and shorter ones thusly._ [BR]]

(We got a flurry of new list members at Arisia [2017], and it's been a while
since I talked about this on list, so some background is probably in
order.)

MaltCon is a "virtual con within a con", taking place within the
context of a literary SF convention.  (It is possible for a MaltCon to
take place outside that context, but it has not thus far.)

It began in 2005.  MaltCon member **Laura Anne Gilman** was Executive
Editor at the Roc Books SF/fantasy imprint of Penguin/Putnam, and
maintained a newsgroup on SFF.Net.  Various of the Usual Suspects were
hanging out in her group, and saying 

> "Philcon is fast approaching.
Has anyone heard from Programming about what they want us to do?"

Philcon was being its usual "Wait till *after* the last minute" self,
and no one had.  (It's better about that now.)  The discussion reduced
to 

> "We'll all be together at a con, in a hotel with a good bar and
single malt selection.  We'll find each other, have single malt, and
have fun.  Who *cares* what Programming does?"

Philcon 2005 was \[the [last](https://fancyclopedia.org/Philcon) held\] at Center City Marriott. 
The badge art was a picture Tom Powers had taken of LAG's hand holding a wee dram.
Laura Anne is our patroness in consequence. [^2012-03-21]


A light bulb blinked on over my head - MaltCon, a virtual con within a
con.  I created MaltCon badges (whose graphic was a picture of Laura
Anne's hand holding a tasting glass of scotch), and gave them out at
Philcon.  

It started an informal tradition. For a few years, MaltCon was *very*
low key.  You encountered me at a con.  I had a flask.  Perhaps you
did too.  We shared single malt and I gave you a badge.


People began to say "I have a room where we can get together and share
interesting drams", and it started to become a group.  

[_So_] I created this mailing list as a
Google Group in March of 2008 as a way we could keep in touch, plan
for future gatherings, and share news and notes on spirits.

[_Dennis's 2008 MaltCon Google Group (aka list) invitation message:_]

> Since it seems to be taking on a life of its own, I thought I'd take MaltCon 
to the next level. I've created a mailing list for the Usual Suspects to hang 
out, plan for future instances of MaltCon, and discuss our favorite beverage. 
I anticipate the list will be low traffic. 

> This is not a public list. Membership is by invitation, and the group is not 
visible in Google's public lists or searches. If you know other folks you 
think should be here, drop me their names and email addresses offline. 

> ... it's the day after Lunacon, with too little sleep and lots
of single malt ... I look forward to your presence.
[^2008-03-17_invitation]

[_Official Group description:_] [^2008-03-17_description] 

> A discussion area for members of MaltCon, the "virtual con within a con" 
devoted to the joys of single malt whiskey.

[Bill:] _Backspacing to January 2004,  my family met **Elaine Brennan** 
while having brunch at a Park Plaza Arisia, 2004, 
discussing upcoming local WorldCon, Noreascon 4.
We quickly discovered Scotch was among our shared interests.
Elaine was aware of several sets of Fans (and Pros) who had small Scotch sharing circles out of sight._

> There have always been bottles of single malts at Smofcon, and those bottles have always been shared 
> -- even well before Maltcon became a thing. 
[-Elaine] [^2017-12-01_Elaine]

[Bill:] _Elaine introduced me to TechnoFandom's custom of carrying a road case of leftover party supplies 
(though I knew some of TF previously through NESFA + Boskone). 
(And thereby we also got to use the Presidential Suite's lavatory used by President Clinton.)
We hatched a plot to attempt to cross-fertilize those multiple circles._ [^2017-04-05_Bill]

[Bill:] _I did some TF work at Noreascon 4 and took a special-order bottle of Caol Ila Cognac Finish 
to the N4 TF party. (G&M PC, special order with Joe @ Federal, I told him 
I'd take two bottles if i could get it by N4; took MBTA to pick it up Saturday of con.
Amazingly most at TF party complained it was too smokey.
Elaine was by then laid-up with a stress-fracture of the foot;
we spent a few hours with Elaine and Pam entertaining each other with tales
and me pouring Caol Ila for Elaine and applying first cold then warm compresses to the foot — not a cure, but it sure helped :-)
Once Dennis coined the phrase MaltCon and invited badges-as-invites,
we became a committee of three on this mission._ [BR]
[^2009-01-12_Bill] , [^2014-03-13_Bill]

[Back to Dennis:]

Whenever there are enough folks with hip
flasks, and **Bill**, **Elaine**, or I get a chance to make badges, Presto!
Instant MaltCon. Just add single malt. [^2008-12-14]

[_Going forward, Bill, **Paul, and RKOV** are the carriers of MaltCon label. And we hope someday Elaine again?_ \[BR]\]

I met Bill Ricker at Arisia in 2001.   
[_OTOH, it might have been 2004? Dennis was on InnKeeper desk._ \[BR\]]  
[_Dennis remembered meeting Elaine at MilPhil 2001._ \[offlist email Dennis to BR\]]

Bill was a major scotch fan, and had a road
case of interesting things he'd accumulated, so Bill's stock formed
the base for early group efforts.  

[Bill: _I describe that as the stones for making [**stone soup**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Soup).
At the time, Seth and I were both on good bonus plans and were actively collecting. Seth came by airplane so he brought a lot of very small samples. I travelled by car so brought the larger ones, and thus variety was assured. 
<br />**Stones for Stone soup**. <br />¶ My road case was acquired cheap at the [MIT Swapfest](https://w1mx.mit.edu/flea-at-mit/) to ship Scotch (**Black Adder "Smoking Islay"**, 55% bot.2006) and the world's ugliest ashtray (same sourcing as road case) to the west-coast when celebrating winter holidays with my mentor in Scotch, Technico-Aesthetic Criticism, and SciFi as Lit Crit, **[Mike "MAP" Padlipsky](../MAP/)**.  <br />This dram was subject of the first reply [^2008-03-17_reply] on MaltCon list, approriately enough by patroness Laura Anne Gilman aka LAG!
<br />On which trip MAP blind-tasted me on **McCarthy's Oregon Peated Whiskey**, Clear Creek Dis., challenging me to guess the age and location; I did not guess Oregon 3y/o.
When I told this to **Joe @ Federal**, he reached back without looking and picked it off the shelf for me.
(Which is excactly what his boss Len had done a decade earlier when i asked for a better but affordable cognac.) So those were the two drams in my two "try this" blind tasting flasks at Arisia a few weeks later.
<br />One of the bottles I opened at [MAP's Wake](../MAP/Malt/tasting.html) will be at Dennis's MaltCon remembrance(s)._]


"The donations will make their next appearance at the
[_next MaltCon_] Expression … and become part of group stocks." 
[^2017-04-09]


It's taken on a life of its own.  There [have been] formal MaltCon
Expressions at Arisia, Boskone, [Lunacon,] Heliosphere, [ReaderCon,] Albacon, Philcon, 
[_and one or two official at each of WorldCon & World Fantasy Con_ \[_merged from_ [^2012-10-04]\]].


[B]ut there are unofficial gatherings at other places that are planned 
on this list, like gatherings at Worldcons.  There are also gathering similar to
ours elsewhere.  For instance, Covert Beach holds scotch parties at
Balticon and Capclave[;] MaltCon has an overlapping membership with his
efforts, and his gatherings get announced here.  If Bill or I should
make one of Covert's events, we're civilians.  It's his show and he
does it well. 
[_Now called **"Quiet Gathering"**, with **Bob MacIntosh** and **Mike Nelson**, well known among MaltCon, as coordinators._ \[BR\]] 

MaltCon began with an emphasis on single malts, but I've been pushing
to expand the group's taste. We've always had bourbon, which is at
least a first cousin, but my assumption is that every spirit has
offerings considered top shelf.  Educate me!  Share some with us.
Tell us how quality is defined in your preferred spirit, and what
makes you like to drink it.  That expansion has been proceeding
nicely, and gin, tequila, rye and other things can now be found in our
spread.


The emphasis is on sharing, and at this point, everything you see laid
out at an Expression was contributed by MaltCon members.
[_We strongly suggest sharing at next visit; first visit it's not expected._]
Some bottles go back home with their owners, and others were donated to the group
stocks for which Bill is the Curator. [The Stone Soup is doing well. Thank you all!]


MaltCon is a virtual con within a con. It is a separate function that
just happens to take place at an SF convention, and [usually] has no formal or
official connection with the surrounding con. It is a private party
hosted in the room of a guest at the hotel and the guest may have whom
they please in their room. …
Attendance at a MaltCon expression requires an invite or a MaltCon
badge (and invitees without a badge are normally given one at the
expression.) There is *no* requirement for a membership in the
surrounding convention, and people invited may have no interest in the
surrounding con. They are there because of whisky, not SF.
If there is a requirement that an attendee at the party be a member of
the surrounding convention in addition to having a MaltCon badge or
being a MaltCon invitee, that party is *not* a MaltCon expression, and
the actual MaltCon expression will take place in a space that does not
impose that requirement.  [^2012-10-04]

In keeping with its virtual nature, MaltCon has only as much
organization as is necessary to function.  We have not yet had actual
programming, though that's not out of the question.  Bill *has* done a
"tour of Scotland in four drams", as an introduction to single malts
for new attendees unfamiliar with them, but whether that occurs
depends on the expression, and whether there is time and space for it.


One tradition that *has* arisen is that I sometimes lead formal
**"Absent Friends"** and ***"Fuck Cancer!"*** toasts to those no longer with us
[_and as wishes for friends fighting Cancer_[BR]].  
A depressing number are folks I knew personally, and several were
MaltCon attendees and on this list.

[_And now we add **Dennis** himself to that list; as many as I can reconstruct are listed below._ [BR]]

My response when asked why I do this is simple. <br /> "I want to have a
party at the con I want to attend, with fine spirits I want to drink,
and attended by people I want to hang out with at a con." <br /> Knowledge of
spirits if not required - we can impart it.  Congeniality is.  We've
had very few altercations between people who just didn't get along,
and I want it to stay that way. 
[^2017-04-12]

MaltCon Expressions have somewhat different characters, influenced by
size and location.  Arisia [was] by far the largest Expression, and size
brings other things in its wake.  A few years back we shifted to
Stealth mode, where we deliberately try to be as low key as possible.
Arisia is a party con skewing to a younger demographic, and we had too
many problems with folks whose spider sense detected a party and were
looking to get hammered.  That's not what we're about.  We're about
tasting and learning. We try to avoid people even knowing we exist
unless we tell them. 
<br />[_and since then it's gotten even more careful if at all there_[BR]]

The Boskone Expression is similar to Arisia's, with an overlapping
attendance, but is smaller because Boskone is.

Albacon is a small relaxacon, with a tiny fraction of Arisia's attendance.  
The Albacon Expression will be a main con party, 
and [2019]'s GoH Chuck Gannon is a MaltCon member.
<br />[_MaltCon was invited to Albacon._[BR]]

At Philcon, MaltCon is the _de facto_ pro party since SFWA no longer
hosts a party there, and [has been] unofficially assisted by the con.

HELIOsphere [was] a new con, and [which desired a] new MaltCon Expression.

[_ReaderCon and Lunacon had had MaltCon in years gone by,_
(_see time-line in appendices_)
_and we'll be returning to ReaderCon by invitation this summer 2025._ [BR]]

I think I also speak for Bill here when I say I'm *delighted* at the
way MaltCon has progressed. [_Agreed!_ [BR]]

Thank you all for being part of it.

## 2017 — 2025


[Bill:] 

_The impetous for the publishing of this page is to let Dennis speak to his legacy, 
so I've not attempted to continue the history into the future **yet**._

_2017 through 2019 continued roughly as Dennis outlined in the 2017 draft (as augmented) above._

_After Boskone 2020, MaltCon joined the Host Cons in Plague Virtual mode._

_As Cons returned to Hybrid and then full-but-careful in-person, neither Bill (protecting vulnerable relatives) nor Dennis (health declining) were travelling, much so Denis (having discussed with Bill and iirc Elaine) deputized **Rick Kovalcik** (RKOV) and **Paul Kraus** to keep things moving._


__TODO__ _fill in_

-------------

## 2025 —

**Dennis McCunney** died **2025-04-29** after a long battle with Cancer (***Fuck Cancer!***). 
He was so optimistic about the experimental, tailored treatments available at the nearby research center,
which may have provided some partial remission but — gone too soon.

***MaltCon will continue***, _with Bill, Paul, and RKOV leading (and Elaine as Wise but Remote Elder, perhaps someday back in the fray? )._
_More details TBD, after we properly remember Dennis at **ReaderCon**. We intend to do likewise at **Albacon** and **Philcon**._

## End Notes: The Emails

Emails by Dennis McCunney, to MaltCon List, except as noted.

As can be inferred from date of Mailing List invitations,
and first message [^2008-03-17_first], and reply being Monday March 17, 2008,
the list was launched the day after Lunacon 2008, the 51st Lunacon,
at Hilton Rye Town aka Escher Hilton. 

<br />[_There had been MaltCon at 50th Lunacon the year before, but due to 'flu and a storm, I [BR] had to roll my membership, so I wasn't with Dennis for that one._[BR]]

[_As nearly as I can reconstruct, it'd have been Arisa 2006 MaltCon than Dennis introduced me to GMail, when it was only 1½ years old, newer than Google Groups!_[BR]]

[_End-notes in HTML will be arranged in order Used; in MarkDown, they are arranged in order by date._]

    2008-03-17

    DMcCunney dennis.mccunney@gmail.com has invited you to join the MaltCon group with this message:
    
    Hi, folks,
    
    Since it seems to be taking on a life of its own, I thought I'd take MaltCon 
    to the next level. I've created a mailing list for the Usual Suspects to hang 
    out, plan for future instances of MaltCon, and discuss our favorite beverage. 
    I anticipate the list will be low traffic. 
    
    This is not a public list. Membership is by invitation, and the group is not 
    visible in Google's public lists or searches. If you know other folks you 
    think should be here, drop me their names and email addresses offline. 
    
    A couple of you have spouses whose email addresses I don't have handy. Please 
    invite them. And feel free to smack me on the head and say "Hey, stupid! You 
    forgot X!", because it's the day after Lunacon, with too little sleep and lots
    of single malt, and I undoubtedly have.
    
    I look forward to your presence.
    
    Cheers,
    
    Dennis

    Group (list) Homepage description

    A discussion area for members of MaltCon, the "virtual con within a con" 
    devoted to the joys of single malt whiskey.


[^2008-03-17_first]: 2008-03-17_first [First Post](https://groups.google.com/g/maltcon/c/5b34bCii4OU/m/NoKQzwscBlcJ)

    Welcome to the MaltCon mailing list. The list is an adjunct to the
    virtual con within a con devoted to the joys of single malt whiskey,
    where members can keep in touch and discuss our favorite beverage when
    a MaltCon isn't actually taking place somewhere.

    This is a moderated invitation only list. The atmosphere is relaxed
    and rules are few. This is a place for hanging out and casual
    conversation. The main topic is single malt whiskey, but I know
    better than to expect that is all that might be discussed. As long as
    things wander back on topic occasionally, I'm happy.

    It's possible that disagreements will occur. That happens too,
    especially in subjective matters of taste. If it starts to get heated
    and personal, take it to private email, so the rest of us don't have
    to listen.

    Beyond that, come on in, kick off your shoes, pour a shot of your
    favorite brand, and relax in good company.

    Cheers!

    Dennis McCunney

    Virtual Con Chair

    > Caol Ila Cognac finish that I had at Noreascon [IV]:  was in this series;
    sadly not in current offerings, the Tokaji or Sassicaia barrel offerings don't do it for me. (although the Caol Ila Madeira wood was fine a few years ago.)
    (This line also includes some seriously old vintages, 1940's-1970's, but those and "Generations" 70yo won't be in a public tasting.)
    I also have Imperial Port Wood PC.
    You might think i like G&M from the above ... you'd be right.

    This omits the rest of the legend.
    I ordered it at a tasting shortly before N4, 
    telling  Joe @ Federal if he could get it for me for Noreascon I'd take two, one for con one for later. 
    It came in after I'd already moved into hotel, so I had to take T and a backpack to fetch it.
    I spent an evening applying cold then warm compresses to Elaine's damaged foot and Caol Ila to rest of Elaine.
    It didn't cure Elaine's foot, but it sure helped :-). 
    The walkway from Pru to Marriot C-P had locked down by the time my kidlet was swooning in wee-hours (so much for staying awake 24 hours!), so I tipped a cab handsomely to drive us one block from Sheraton.
    
    (N4 was September 2004.)

    TF had the Presidential Suite at the Park Plaza (when Elaine took Pam and
    me up to start cross-fertilizing the previously insular fannish-malt cliques),
    complete with a Bidet in the lavatory.
    (A little creepy to realize the Clintons had used that exact toilet.)

    > (PK) > That was 2013 … 2014 became 2014.5 and was held in May of 2015 … because we could not find an appropriate and affordable facility for the fall of 2014. And since we decided we were not holding an Albacon in 2015 because of World Fantasy, we called it 2014.5 and decided that the Wombat would have approved (he was the Ghost of Honor).)

    > Those of you at Boskone MaltCon may have heard rumors this weekend of our beloved Joe at Federal's health.
    
    > Long story short in interest of privacy, Joe Howell's heart-attack last week was as benign as such a life-threatening event can be - his heart is actually fine; it was caused by the systemic stress of another serious medical condition, which it brought to appropriate attention, and for which he's now had the initial surgery. But he faces a long rehab road to recovery now.

    > I note in passing "**The Holdovers**" was nominated in multiple BAFTAs categories, and won for Susan Shopmaker, casting dir., for "Casting"  and for  Da'Vine Joy Randolph, "Best Supporting Actress".   
    > Given the previously noted media buzz/discussion of Joe's scene and one line, I'll consider the "Casting" win a partial win for Joe ;-) .  Losing to *Oppenheimer* in other categories is no shame this year - BAFTA was all about serious films this year; even *Barbie*, a comedy with a heart of serious commentary, got blanked. For a 1970s period-piece comedy-of-manners to get anything was sailing against headwinds of history.
    
    My prior (2023) comments on list re this photo:  
    
    > And in his natural environment - they'd rented the store for the evening shoot.
    
    > They did a very nice job of "stage setting" to make it reasonably authentically 1970s package store, so I heard.
    > (1970s is before Lennie bought the store - he bought mid 80's and upgraded the stock and clientele,
    > and later hired Joe who took Scotch to the next level.)
    > IDK if they borrowed actual antique bottles from collectors or created replicas; probably heard at the time.
    
    > I saw the 1970s swoosh graphics still on the beer coolers a few days later, still in place.
