decentralized social networking protocol, playing nicely with
others.</p>
<p><a href="https://fediverse.party/"

and were started 2014-2018.</p>
<ul>
<li>diaspora* (<strong>Macro</strong>blogging; supports Markdown;
2010)</li>
<li>Friendica (<strong>Macro</strong>blogging; 2010)</li>

<h1>Other “choices” ?</h1>
<p>Mostly just like Twitter, Non-Federated &amp; Centralized, but with
additional problems; but a few are Non-Federated &amp;/or Centralized in
some sense.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Private-Label Social</strong><br />
There is (are?) <a href="https://www.disciplemedia.com/">firm(s)</a>
selling turn-key Social Media phone+web apps that will provide a
walled-garden community for the sponsor’s palls. At remarkably low rates
since the app is merely branded for each client.<br />
Likely invitation-only or sponsor’s mailing list / website only.
<em>That reminds me i need to check the Beta …</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Alt-Right choices</strong> (without fact-checking)<br />
(which private gardens might be purchased from above vendor(s)?)</p>
<ul>
<li>“Truth” Social</li>
<li>Parler</li>
<li>Rumble ? <em>never heard of it but it’s listed</em></li>
<li>Newsmax <em>news app’s comment section, or do they have a full
social walled garden?</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Old School</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>antique bboards/forums - Web 1.0 ports of Dialup Bulletin Boards
(usually obsolete PHP code) e.g. <code>/.</code>, <code>reddit</code>,
<code>4chan</code> etc, various Forums packages</li>
<li>MetaFilter</li>
<li>IRC still exists ! ( <em>even tho newer AIM, G-chat gateway, etc
have shut down</em> )<br />
IRC is <strong>decentralized</strong> - lots of servers - but theyre
<strong>not</strong> Federated; so while FLOSS and standards-coforming
for no lock-in, moving hosts is painful, as we found out when an old
reliable FLOSS-friendly host got sold.</li>
<li>Slack (commercial multimedia chat for corps; some FLOSS project use
it instead of dogfooding FLOSS because they have Slack at day-job, it
just works (same as the MacBook Air), <em>etc</em> )</li>
<li>USEnet mostly doesn’t exist anymore (<em>and the history is hard to
find</em>) but a few of the old news groups live yet! Somewhat Federated
&amp; decentralized, but with Google Groups defacto Center, less so than
in the good old days.</li>
<li>Mailing lists ( <em>like our NatickFoss discussion list</em> ) -
since there are list-servers other than Google,
<strong>decentralized</strong>, and if you forward to another list,
somewhat <strong>federated</strong> ! But very old school in handling of
media attachments.</li>
<li>Blogs with RSS and automatic track-back links. <strong>Federated
&amp; decentralized</strong>.</li>
<li>WebRings - <strong>Federated &amp; decentralized</strong>!</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Alt-Left alternatives? (or Alt and not
Alt-Right??)</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>or at least, pro-Democracy, and suppressing “fake news” is
fact-based. But not necessarily Progressive or “left”.</p>
<p><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluesky_%28protocol%29">BlueSky</a>
looks to federate by its own rules, unlcear if bridging to Fediverse
ActivityPub would be plausible or allowed.</p>
<pre><code>* **BlueSky** - BlueSKy is apparently a Protocol in competition with the Fediverse&#39;s ActivityPub, with a demo implementation only just in Beta; backed by Dorsey, to make something that his Twitter could&#39;ve been but didn&#39;t as “protocol for large-scale distributed social applications that will allow for account portability, algorithmic choice, interoperability and performance&quot;. Anti-commercial. [oct.25 article](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/jack-dorsey-bluesky-social-app-twitter-050005805.html). Started as a Twitter FLOSS spinoff? Original rumors of Blockchain denied. Dorsey BlueSky [may be collaborative](https://davetroy.medium.com/no-elon-and-jack-are-not-competitors-theyre-collaborating-3e88cde5267d) with Musk Twitter!?(_sounds like a conspiracy theory but by an insider so might be real?_)  Not ready yet. Intersting to watch.

* **TribelSocial** claims to be pro-Democracy, but is reportedly just as data-harvesting as the big Socials where we&#39;re the product, not the customer.</code></pre>

<h1>Mastodon Microblogging : TOOT to the Fediverse</h1>
<p><a href="https://fediverse.party/en/mastodon/"
class="uri">https://fediverse.party/en/mastodon/</a></p>
<p><strong>Mastodon</strong> is the current center of the Federated
Multi-Verse (Fediverse) per above graph from Fediverse Party data.</p>
</div>
<div id="not-exactly-what-youre-expecting" class="slide section level3">
<h1>Not exactly what you’re expecting?</h1>
<p>Instead of Tweeting, we <strong>Post</strong> (or
<strong>Toot</strong> if one wants a pun); instead of
<code>#Twitterstorians</code>, there are <code>#Histodonts</code>; there
is no Verified ✓ , just verified URLs. Unless you buy a server, there’s
usually no charge, just a <strong>tip jar</strong>.</p>
<p>Instead of an edge-cloud with eventual-consistency distributed DB run
by one mega corp, Fediverse is scaled by having many collaborating
instances under separate management that collaborite, each scaling
according to own daily output &amp; input, and funds available.</p>
<p>Each instance server can <em>but is not required to</em> exchange
content with (most) others, Mastodon or fork or other compatible project
(see chart).</p>
<p>Each instance sets it’s <strong>own content policy, moderation
policy, privacy policy</strong>, open enrollment or invite only, etc.,
and picks which nodes it trusts to federate with.</p>
<p>(E.g. <a href="https://mastodon.radio">mastodon.radio</a> does NOT
accept federation with nodes that have a looser a policy registered, or
fail to enforce their stated policy, e.g., <code>masthead.social</code>
which is nominally for journalists, whose policy <em>says</em>
<strong>NoSpam</strong>, but is actually just unmoderated spam. This
isn’t censorship, this is decentralized federation providing for policy
backbone.)</p>
<p>Since there’s no Algorithm, Favorites ⭐ are like they <em>used to
be</em> on Twitter ages ago before they adulterated it with faceless
<code>^</code>Algorithms<code>^</code>: they tell the author you like it
(and perhaps them), but doesn’t help the post fly further. If you want
to boost the post, you use the Boost 🔄 button to relay it to your own
Followers (like RT on bluebirdapp).</p>
<p>Also since there’s no Algorithm, <strong>#HashTag</strong> all the
things.</p>

<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>Mastodon DMs are not encrypted, and instead of being readable only
by any Twitter DevOps who cares to gain privilege (or comply with a
government order/request), are readable by sender &amp; recipient’s node
admins, whomever they are. A DM is just a Post or Reply with Visibility
reset from default (likely World <strong>🌎</strong>) to Private
(<strong>🖂</strong>), addresee(s) only. Arguably even worse substitute
for secure messaging than Twitter DM.<br />
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>Note that this ‘Visibility’ means DMs go to EVERYONE who is
@-mentioned therein; so omit the @’s if you’re trying to talk ABOUT
someone privately!!</li>

<p>elucidating that what’s different is this decentralized, federated
social network is not that it’s novel, but that it’s not the private
walled garden of singular mega-corporation, it’s a return to how things
used to be in real life and in Internet 1.0, but with the sort of modern
interface that set Twitter apart from e.g. Usenet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have to disagree with my friends who keep hammering on the idea
that people shouldn’t say Mastodon is confusing. The user experience is
fine (it’s confusing, but not in any unexpected ways, and you can figure
it out). But onboarding process, ambushing prospective users to choose a
server, is something lots of people have trouble with. Not at even
acknowledging that it’s confusing amplifies how off putting this can
be.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’m no expert here, I’ve only been around for a few days. But I’ve
helped a number of people sign up, and every one of them has been
BAFFLED by this. So was I when I signed up. Claiming that it’s not
confusing just signals that they aren’t welcome, or that this place
isn’t for them.</p>

<pre><code>okay more new user tips
content warnings are extremely important here

Intro post to CW</a></p>
<p>This is more built-in in Mastodon &amp; ActivityPub, and enforced; it
was just a convention in TW&amp;FB. Each node will have policy as to
which Content Warnings are <em>required</em> on their node, and nodes
with tighter warning policy will not accept un-warned content from those
with looser. Failure to abide by home-node CW policy is expected to
result in “Moderation” (which may be timeout/warning or straight
boot/ban if Mods are busy, guess what, it’s AOL September for Mastodon,
they’re busy).</p>
<p>It’s suggested that <strong>Twitter</strong> is a content-warning
topic as well as the usual.</p>

<p>There are no “verified” badges on here. If you see someone using a
symbol like :verified: it’s just a custom emoji that means absolutely
nothing.<br />
However, there are still ways you can verify your identity on here. For
example we know that the European Commission’s official account is <span

Here’s an article going through how to verify your account on Mastodon

<blockquote>
<p>When you write threads, you can set the visibility of all the reply
posts to “Unlisted”. This way all the non-initial posts won’t flood user
timelines in reverse chronological order (and interspersed between
others’ toots), which can confuse. People will just see the initial post
and upon clicking that see the whole thread.</p>

<p>Mastodon gGmbH is a non-profit (only since 2021), but that is not
what makes it ”not possible to buy”. The software is licensed under the
GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 so any code based on it, or any
modifications, have to be made freely available.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I guess a big player can come in and make a big instance and lure
people there (easier-to-use, better performance, apps, etc) but they
would have to surrender and make available any code changes for
free.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Now a billionaire could just refuse and drag things out in court. But
Mastodon as we see it would still be open source and free and possible
to install for anyone. The community would likely rally to best any
improvements.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So there is no way a billionaire can take away the premise of
open-source software and our option to use Mastodon for free. But they
could use all sorts of tactics to make something else appear more
attractive. Some may be seduced.</p>

<p>Ovid asks a great question -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q. Given the federated nature of Mastodon, if a server goes away
(domain expires, doesn’t pay the bills, etc.) do I lose my account? (And
thus, do I forever lose my history unless I’ve backed it up?)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My answer</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A. yes and no. The JoinMastodon index compact requires 60 day notice
of node shutdown. The account transfer tool moves profile, follows, and
(amazinglu) followers. This works, someone ran into life events and had
announced they can’t transfer years of trust to new Ops quickly, so
shutting at EOY. Posts alas aren’t transferable - I’m guessing because
no algorithm to assure bulk remoderation to new host policies? But also,
under POSSE, better to treat microblog as ephemeral, save the good ones
into a macroblog or static web page?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Obviously if a node goes down unexpectedly and irrecoverably, well,
that’s bad and sad. Volunteer run nodes fueld off tip-jars are NOT
expected to have cross-region disaster recovery replication let along
in-region hot-spares.)</p>

<li>Basic Mastodon <strong>web</strong> interface (default on most
instance nodes) looks like TweetDeck in Dark mode: it has Columns. You
can monitor <code>#NatickFoss</code> or <code>@algot@mastodon.art</code>
in a column.

<li>There are a couple choices in iOS <strong>Apple App</strong> Store
and <strong>Android Google Play</strong> Store, which get different
reviews from different people. They look more like Twitter Android, but
differ how Local vs Federated feeds are navigated to. Both have
requested Notifications permission only (if turned on). I presume will
request access Pictures (&amp; files?) if i try to post a picture from
it?

<li><strong>Mastodon</strong> (official Android client) - has a small
index of major thematic nodes in Start page.</li>
<li>if you run both on same device, eventually either disable/remove one
or turn off notifications on one!!</li>
<li>Similar choices for <strong>iOS</strong>, i haven’t tested.</li>
